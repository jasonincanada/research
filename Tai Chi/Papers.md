[Integrating Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Treatment With 8-Week Tai Chi Chuan Practice: An Exploration of Mind-Body Intervention and Neural Mechanism](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2022.849481) (2022)

- first study on the effect of tai chi practice on brain function in patients with COPD
- 8 weeks of tai chi practice 3 times a week for 90 minutes

### results

- "The primary outcome was the improvement of clinical symptoms in COPD. Paired-samples $t$-test showed that after 8-week intervention, CAT score significantly improved after treatment compared to baseline [p < 0.001], but there was no significant change in mMRC [p > 0.05]" p. 3
- "Intriguingly, the improved pulmonary symptoms were positively associated with the decreased DC [Degree of Centrality] value in the IFG [interior frontal gyrus], which suggested that IFG might be the key brain region related to the neural mechanism of the effects of routine treatment integrating with TCC practice on COPD." p. 4
- "correlation analysis found that the decreased DC in the right IFG was positively correlated with the CAT improvements." p. 1

### study limitations

- relatively small sample size ($n = 20$)
- no control group for routine treatment without tai chi

- "Neuroscientists have found that if you meditate regularly, you not only become good at it but also improve your self-control, self-knowledge, attention, stress management, and the ability to resist impulses ... TC is a comprehensive mind-body exercise with both martial arts and meditation components and has the unique advantage of being easy to learn, safe and effective." p. 2

- "Existing studies have shown that TC has a very significant effect in terms of exercise intervention, which can not only improve physical fitness, including fall prevention, hypertension reduction, and cardiac rehabilitation, but also has certain benefits to mental health, including improvement of quality of life and self-efficacy, emotional processing and other problems, and even has some beneficial effects on the improvement of patients with depression. Meanwhile, TC can also significantly improve peopleâ€™s sleep quality and mental state." p. 2 (refs elided)

- "In 2010, Field observed that performances on math computations (including speed and accuracy) of participants were significantly improved by a 20-min TC training course and associated with an increase in frontal EEG theta activity [(Field et al., 2010)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ctcp.2010.05.014)." p. 2

### reaction time

"Compared with the control group, the subjects in the TC group seemed to have a faster reaction speed." p. 5

### discussion

"The alpha band analysis of EEG showed that TC practice significantly improved the activation of the prefrontal lobes of the practitioners, enhanced functional neuroplasticity of the brain, and also increased the reaction speed of the practitioners." p. 9

"The nodal degree of the two groups was significantly different in the FP1 and FP2 nodes of the frontal lobe and the T3 and T4 nodes of the temporal lobe, with advanced cognitive functions, such as learning, language, decision making, abstract thinking, emotion, and so on, while the temporal lobe is related to memory and emotion, and the amygdala in the anterior temporal lobe is the core area that regulates emotion. The node degree of the frontal lobe and temporal lobe in the TC group was higher than that in the control group, which indirectly reflected that the practice of TC had a positive effect on the advanced cognitive functions." p. 9

"After the practice of TC, the shortest path length between the nodes in the brain functional network of the TC group became shorter, that is, the number of edges from one node to another decreased. Furthermore, under a single sparse degree, the TC group showed higher global efficiency, which further indicated that compared with the control group, the transmission efficiency of the information carried by each node in the TC group is higher at the global level of the brain. This indirectly proved that after the practice of TC, the degree of functional integration within the brain is enhanced. On the other hand, a higher clustering coefficient in the TC group revealed that the nodes in the brain functional network of the TC group had a higher degree of aggregation at the local level of the brain, that is, for the whole brain region, the connection density between nodes decreased, while the higher local efficiency of the TC group showed that the information transmission efficiency of the nodes in the brain functional network of the TC group was higher than that of the control group at the local level." p. 9

Summary: "Our nervous systems can learn optimal control policies in response to changes to our bodies, tasks, and movement contexts... However, it is unclear how the nervous system determines which ways to adapt its control policy. Here, we asked how human participants explore through variations in their control policy to identify more optimal policies in new contexts. ... We found that, across all of these analyzed variables, variability increased upon initial exposure to new contexts and then decreased with experience. ... The timescales by which adaptive changes progressed and variability decreased were faster for some variables than others, suggesting a reduced search space within which the nervous system continues to optimize its policy. ..."

Editor's evaluation: "This paper will be of interest to researchers in the fields of biomechanics, movement control, and decision making. A novel, mechanistic model of metabolic cost is presented to account for a phenomenon not explained by current models of metabolic energy. This is followed by a demonstration of how this metabolic model can improve our understanding of movement control by revealing an energetic basis for smooth movements."
