[The energetic basis for smooth human arm movements](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.68013) (2021)

Editor's evaluation: "This paper will be of interest to researchers in the fields of biomechanics, movement control, and decision making. A novel, mechanistic model of metabolic cost is presented to account for a phenomenon not explained by current models of metabolic energy. This is followed by a demonstration of how this metabolic model can improve our understanding of movement control by revealing an energetic basis for smooth movements."
