[Integrating Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Treatment With 8-Week Tai Chi Chuan Practice: An Exploration of Mind-Body Intervention and Neural Mechanism](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2022.849481) (2022)

- first study on the effect of tai chi practice on brain function in patients with COPD
- 8 weeks of tai chi practice 3 times a week for 90 minutes

### results

- "The primary outcome was the improvement of clinical symptoms in COPD. Paired-samples $t$-test showed that after 8-week intervention, CAT score significantly improved after treatment compared to baseline [p < 0.001], but there was no significant change in mMRC [p > 0.05]" p. 3
- "Intriguingly, the improved pulmonary symptoms were positively associated with the decreased DC [Degree of Centrality] value in the IFG [interior frontal gyrus], which suggested that IFG might be the key brain region related to the neural mechanism of the effects of routine treatment integrating with TCC practice on COPD." p. 4
- "correlation analysis found that the decreased DC in the right IFG was positively correlated with the CAT improvements." p. 1

### study limitations

- relatively small sample size ($n = 20$)
- no control group for routine treatment without tai chi

Summary: "Our nervous systems can learn optimal control policies in response to changes to our bodies, tasks, and movement contexts... However, it is unclear how the nervous system determines which ways to adapt its control policy. Here, we asked how human participants explore through variations in their control policy to identify more optimal policies in new contexts. ... We found that, across all of these analyzed variables, variability increased upon initial exposure to new contexts and then decreased with experience. ... The timescales by which adaptive changes progressed and variability decreased were faster for some variables than others, suggesting a reduced search space within which the nervous system continues to optimize its policy. ..."

Editor's evaluation: "This paper will be of interest to researchers in the fields of biomechanics, movement control, and decision making. A novel, mechanistic model of metabolic cost is presented to account for a phenomenon not explained by current models of metabolic energy. This is followed by a demonstration of how this metabolic model can improve our understanding of movement control by revealing an energetic basis for smooth movements."
