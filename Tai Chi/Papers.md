[Integrating Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Treatment With 8-Week Tai Chi Chuan Practice: An Exploration of Mind-Body Intervention and Neural Mechanism](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2022.849481) (2022)

- first study on the effect of tai chi practice on brain function in patients with COPD
- 8 weeks of tai chi practice 3 times a week for 90 minutes

### results

- "The primary outcome was the improvement of clinical symptoms in COPD. Paired-samples $t$-test showed that after 8-week intervention, CAT score significantly improved after treatment compared to baseline [p < 0.001], but there was no significant change in mMRC [p > 0.05]" p. 3
- "Intriguingly, the improved pulmonary symptoms were positively associated with the decreased DC [Degree of Centrality] value in the IFG [interior frontal gyrus], which suggested that IFG might be the key brain region related to the neural mechanism of the effects of routine treatment integrating with TCC practice on COPD." p. 4
- "correlation analysis found that the decreased DC in the right IFG was positively correlated with the CAT improvements." p. 1

### study limitations

- relatively small sample size ($n = 20$)
- no control group for routine treatment without tai chi

Editor's evaluation: "This paper will be of interest to researchers in the fields of biomechanics, movement control, and decision making. A novel, mechanistic model of metabolic cost is presented to account for a phenomenon not explained by current models of metabolic energy. This is followed by a demonstration of how this metabolic model can improve our understanding of movement control by revealing an energetic basis for smooth movements."
