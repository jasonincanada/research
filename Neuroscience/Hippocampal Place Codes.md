[Hippocampal place codes are gated by behavioral engagement](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-022-01050-4) (2022)

Abstract: "As animals explore an environment, the hippocampus is thought to automatically form and maintain a place code by combining sensory and self-motion signals. Instead, we observed an extensive degradation of the place code when mice voluntarily disengaged from a virtual navigation task, remarkably even as they continued to traverse the identical environment. Internal states, therefore, can strongly gate spatial maps and reorganize hippocampal activity even without sensory and self-motion changes."

"Collectively, our results reveal that the hippocampal spatial code degraded extensively when mice voluntarily disengaged from a goal-directed task. Remarkably, this degradation of the place code occurred even though the mouse experienced the identical visual cues and spatial positions as it ran continually through the virtual environment. Thus, conjunctive sensory and self-motion signals are not sufficient to form a reliable spatial map in the hippocampus, and robust place codes are not always maintained during exploration of an environment. Rather, the active engagement of an animal with its environment is essential for the maintenance of spatial maps and serves as a functional gate on the reliable firing of place cells. Our results challenge the idea that the generation of a spatial map is an automatic and unsupervised process and, instead, indicate that an animalâ€™s internal state can profoundly affect spatial coding in the hippocampus, even in the absence of changes in the external world." p. 4

"Our results raise the possibility that an active mechanism determines the behavioral relevance of an environment and exerts top-down influence to gate spatial representations in CA1. In this case, the change in internal state would modulate the hippocampal place code."  p. 5
