[Pedunculopontine Chx10+ neurons control global motor arrest in mice](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-023-01396-3) #gon23 (2023)

"The neuronal circuits mediating defensive global motor arrest (for example, freezing) are located in the lower brainstem and are activated by neuronal pathways that include the amygdala and the ventral periaqueductal gray as core components." p. 1

- Pedunculopontine nucleus (**PPN**) divides into rostral part receiving inputs mostly from basal ganglia, and caudal part receiving broad somatosensory inputs
- located in upper pons/isthmus, mainly glutamatergic, cholinergic, GABAergic neurons, each with a density gradient along rostrocaudal axis
- researchers found a rostral glutamatergic subpopulation whose activation causes arrest of all ongoing motor activity and near cessation of breathing, with robust resumability of paused motor plan after offset
- a subpopulation of glutamatergic PPNs is [Chx10⁺](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/12677), denser in the rostral half

## Results

- "... unilateral photoactivation (blue light, 40 Hz, 1 s) of Chx10-PPN neurons reliably and abruptly halted locomotion in every trial from all mice", 40 total trials over 8 mice. [video](https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41593-023-01396-3/MediaObjects/41593_2023_1396_MOESM3_ESM.mp4)

![[gon23 fig 2b - velocity during ppn activation.png]]
**Figure 2B** The Chx10-PPN-evoked pause occurred in 100% of trials

- average latency of onset ~110ms, average latency to resume movement after light offset ~150ms
- "... Chx10-PPN neurons play a role in motor control as their activation reliably leads to global motor arrest, while their ablation reduces the amount of naturally occurring arrest events." p. 4

### Chx10-PPN neurons hold movement with a pause-and-play pattern

- This whole section is fascinating. Question: Does PPN activation induce a stereotyped kinematic response or does it truly halt the motor plan in place wherever it was upon activation?
- EEG recordings of limb muscles showed no "new" activity; instead "... the flexor–extensor and left–right alternating pattern observed during walk and trot was paused and kept on hold maintaining a given combination through the stimulation. Both the coordination of activity between muscles and the joint positions during the pause remained constant once the animal adopted its arrest position." p. 5
- the "arrest has a ‘context-dependent’ pattern, where the muscle activity during arrest reflects the position of the limbs at the time of movement interruption." p. 5
- "By plotting all [40] trials together ... we confirmed that Chx10-PPN neurons can pause locomotion at virtually any position, covering the entire range of possible values of left–right limb displacement for forelimbs and hindlimbs." p. 5

![[gon23 fig e5c - no stereotyped kinematics.png]]

**Figure E5C** The pause doesn't start a special kinematic response to "get the mouse into place" but halts it wherever it is, shown in this figure as a uniform scattering of straight lines across the y axis during activation (instead of bunched up somewhere). Shown is the graph for forelimbs; the hindlimbs graph looks the same

"Next, we assessed how the left–right alternation continued once mice resumed locomotion. We found that if the flat line that represents the arrest was virtually cut out of the trace, after light offset the step cycle continued with the expected rhythmic pattern regardless of the left–right coordination pattern during arrest. ... after light offset, mice resumed locomotion by continuing from the same posture they paused, and finished the step cycle with the expected coordination pattern. We called this pattern ‘pause-and-play’ because during the Chx10-PPN-evoked pause the nervous system appeared to keep a memory of the movement, until it released and continued its intended course of action." p. 5

### Apnea and a reduction in heart rate accompany the motor arrest

![[gon23 fig 4d - apnea and bradycardia.png]]

**Figure 4D** The pause evokes a clear reduction in respiratory rate and a more subtle reduction in heart rate. The light is applied for 3s in this figure compared to 1s in the previous figures

![[gon23 fig e7a - breathing prolonged onset.png]]

**Figure E7A** Respiratory trace during a 20s prolonged activation. "Mice first exhibit apnea for up to ~3.5 seconds but resume slow breathing afterwards ensuring survival."

## Discussion

"The present study has uncovered a brainstem command evoked upon activation of Chx10+ neurons in the PPN that mediates a unique type of global motor arrest. The global motor arrest is accompanied by apnea and a reduction in heart rate. The distinctive feature of the Chx10-PPN-evoked global motor arrest is a fast onset and offset and a pause-and-play pattern." p. 11

[Imagining the way forward: A review of contemporary motor imagery theory](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2022.1033493) #hur22 (2022)

**Motor imagery**: the mental rehearsal of physical action without actually moving

Article reviews five contemporary theories and defines them on the basis of this high-level schema:

![[hur22 fig 1 - key stages of motor execution.png]]

**Goal Selection** - current goal (ie: pick up mug) is selected
**High-Level Planning** - translate goal into high-level motor plan
**Plan Encoding** - translate high-level plan into muscle-specific motor signals
**Plan Execution** - send the encoded motor plan to the muscles for action

Article covers five modern theories:
- motor simulation theory (MST)
- motor emulation theory (MET)
- motor-cognitive model (MCM)
- perceptual-cognitive model (PCM)
- effects imagery model (EIM)

## Motor simulaton theory

- motor imagery and execution use the same neural processes up to the point of muscle activation
- actual movement inhibited at some point between plan encoding and action
    - potentially by inhibiting motor commands from getting past the brainstem/spinal cord
    - or reduced motor cortex activity while imagining; ie. output is below threshold required to actually fire motor neurons
- performing action and imagining action are functionally equivalent
- evidence:
    - mental chronometry is similar; ie, imagining an action takes about the same time as performing it
    - neural activation is similar between imagining and actual movement. fMRI studies show both increased activity in central/cingular gyri, supplementary motor area, inferior parietal lobule

![[hur22 fig 2 - motor simulation theory.png]]

**Figure 2** Motor simulation theory.  Theory-specific highlights/changes are enclosed in gray

## Motor emulation theory

- motor system involves an emulation process
- process takes a copy of an encoded motor plan and predicts sensory consequences (known elsewhere as a "forward model" of a motor plan)
- the emulator provides fast feedback to plan encoding during movement, thought to make for faster motor corrections without requiring slower sensory input
- the motor plan you imagine is the emulator's predictions when actual movement is inhibited
- emulator constantly improves its predictions by comparing imagery to actual movement
- similar to prior work on forward models but proposes the modeling process and motor imagery are the same thing: the model's predictions are what we consciously imagine

![[hur22 fig 3 - motor emulation theory.png]]

**Figure 3** Motor emulation theory

## Motor-cognitive model

- imagery and execution use same mechanisms for planning action but diverge at point of execution
    - implies imagery is more cognitively demanding for novel actions compared to well-practiced ones, and
    - the direct pathway from planning to mental simulation means motor plans never get converted into actual motor command format
- generation of imagery has different cognitive demands that performing/monitoring movement
- rejects MST's "functional equivalence"
    - mental chronometry is similar for simple/known movements, but differences increase for complicated/novel actions requiring more cognitive processing
    - distracting the brain with backwards counting during a reaching task impaired movement times for imagery more than action
    - neural correlates of imagery and action are different (imagery involves more frontal areas related to executive processing)

![[hur22 fig 4 - motor cognitive model.png]]

**Figure 4** Motor cognitive model

## Perceptual-cognitive model

- motor imagery is conscious experience of high-level motor planning
- ex: planning to bend the elbow and sensory results of bending elbow are closely associated and stored together; selecting a motor plan activates its associated sensations. these motor/sensory units are called Basic Action Components and form the building blocks of complex motor plans
- key function of high-level motor planning is restructuring BACs for easier retrieval
- views motor imagery as the conscious experience of recalling/organizing BACs into a motor plan without any actual action
- since imagery focuses on organizing high-level planning, it should show faster improvements to BAC organization than physical practice
- evidence: experts in a given task have more structured action representations compared to novices (eg: an expert tennis swing built from three distinct phases instead of one overall swing)

![[hur22 fig 5 - perceptual-cognitive model.png]]

**Figure 5** Perceptual-cognitive model

## Effects imagery model

- other theories view motor imagery as happening after/during the planning process
- EIM proposes imagery is essential part of goal selection *prior* to motor planning
- subject thinks of the desired effects of the action to activate a relevant motor plan
- effects imagery not required to be detailed/fully conscious, only sufficient to trigger a relevant motor plan
- two forms of motor imagery:
    - brief, reflexive that *initiates* motor planning, and detailed form that optionally *follows* motor planning

[Cortical–hippocampal coupling during manifold exploration in motor cortex](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05533-z) #kim22 (2022)

"Systems consolidation—a process for long-term memory stabilization—has been hypothesized to occur in two stages. Whereas new memories require the hippocampus, they become integrated into cortical networks over time, making them independent of the hippocampus. How hippocampal–cortical dialogue precisely evolves during this and how cortical representations change in concert is unknown. ... Our results indicate that precise cross-area coupling between hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and M1 can demarcate two distinct stages of processing. ... Strikingly, even after consolidation, inducing new manifold exploration by changing task parameters re-engages hippocampal–M1 coupling. We thus find evidence for dynamic hippocampal–cortical dialogue associated with manifold exploration during learning and adaptation." (Abstract)

"Strikingly, there is a sharp increase in PFC–M1 SO coupling that coincides with stabilization of performance and manifold consolidation." p. 1

### PFC–M1 SO coupling over long-term skill learning

"Notably, we found significantly higher PFC–M1 SO coupling in the late compared with the early period." p. 2

![[kim22 fig 1cd - pfc-m1 so coupling.png]]

**Figure 1CD** A coupled slow oscillation (SO) occurs when an M1 SO occurs within 200 ms of a PFC SO. The concentration is higher in the late periods vs early periods of learning. "We found a sharp transition around day 6 in all [rats studied]." p. 2

![[kim22 fig 1f - success rate variability.png]]

**Figure 1F** "The transition from low to high PFC–M1 SO coupling occurred as the success rate stabilized." p. 2

### Stepwise drop in M1 SO–SWR coupling

"We next wondered whether the increased PFC–M1 coordination is temporally associated with changes in hippocampus–M1 coordination, as would be predicted for a memory consolidation process in M1 that evolves to become hippocampus-independent." p.3 

![[kim22 fig 2e - pfc-m1 coupling predicts swr-m1 dropoff.png]]

**Figure 2E** "Comparison of stepwise increase of PFC–M1 SO coupling with drop in ΔSO–SWR coupling in single animal (e, top); middle and bottom, sigmoid function fits for each animal."

"To examine temporal links between cross-area coupling transitions, we fit a sigmoid function to each animal’s cross-area coupling. Across six rats, the stepwise dynamics were well predicted by a sigmoid function in ΔSO–SWR coupling in M1 ... and in PFC–M1 SO coupling ... . This increase in PFC–M1 SO coupling—as measured by the midpoint of the sigmoid function fit, that is, the red dot—was followed by a sharp drop in ΔSO– SWR coupling in M1 (blue arrowhead). ... These findings indicate that the full engagement of NREMS PFC–M1 coordination predicts hippocampal–M1 disengagement." pp. 3,4

### Manifold consolidation with drop in SO–SWR coupling

"On the basis of the observed changes in PFC–M1 SO coupling (Fig. 1d), we wondered whether there might be two distinct stages for activity patterns within the M1 manifold. ... we found that between days 5 and 6 was a consistent transition point. This suggested that days 1–5 and days 6–13 represented two periods with distinct rates of change. ... This demarcation revealed an essentially flat slope of approximately zero for days 1–5 (manifold exploration) and then a gradual linear increase trajectory fidelity (manifold consolidation, Fig. 3d,e). Notably, the period of highly variable success rate (Fig. 1f) also appears to be closely related to this transition. Together, these findings raise the possibility that the transition from exploration—associated with variable performance and a low fidelity—to consolidation is temporally linked to changes in PFC–M1 coupling." p. 4

![[kim22 fig 3d - neural trajectory fidelity m1 and pfc.png]]

**Figure 3D** "Neural trajectory fidelity over learning in M1 (top) and PFC (bottom) ... . Lines represent linear regression fits in each animal for either days 1–5 or days 6–13 in M1 and days 1–8 or days 9–13 in PFC. Top: red and magenta dashed lines represent the piecewise linear regression fits of the changes in PFC–M1 SO coupling from Fig. 1d and in success rate from Fig. 1f, respectively. Blue curves represent ΔSO–SWR coupling from Fig. 2d"

## Discussion

"Our results using skill learning provide insights into the precise spatiotemporal coordination of multiple areas throughout systems consolidation. Our observed task-specific reactivations during early manifold exploration suggest a close link between phase-locking of cortical SOs, hippocampal SWRs and cortical reactivations. These results also suggest that hippocampal SWRs may represent a preserved mechanism of consolidation for both declarative and procedural memories." p. 6

"We found that changes in the variability of task activity were temporally associated with stepwise changes in cross-area coupling. Feedback based on task performance and manifold variability may be a key driver to cease hippocampal learning-related engagement and shifts in coordination. Our results also indicate that dialogue across these systems does not end after systems consolidation. In previous studies, reset of pre-existing connectivity stabilized by consolidation was found to facilitate new learning. It is quite possible that ‘unlearning’ and entering an exploratory state is supported by sleep processing." p. 7
