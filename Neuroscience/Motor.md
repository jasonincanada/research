[Cortical–hippocampal coupling during manifold exploration in motor cortex](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05533-z) #kim22 (2022)

"Systems consolidation—a process for long-term memory stabilization—has been hypothesized to occur in two stages. Whereas new memories require the hippocampus, they become integrated into cortical networks over time, making them independent of the hippocampus. How hippocampal–cortical dialogue precisely evolves during this and how cortical representations change in concert is unknown. ... Our results indicate that precise cross-area coupling between hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and M1 can demarcate two distinct stages of processing. ... Strikingly, even after consolidation, inducing new manifold exploration by changing task parameters re-engages hippocampal–M1 coupling. We thus find evidence for dynamic hippocampal–cortical dialogue associated with manifold exploration during learning and adaptation." (Abstract)

"Strikingly, there is a sharp increase in PFC–M1 SO coupling that coincides with stabilization of performance and manifold consolidation." p. 1

### PFC–M1 SO coupling over long-term skill learning

"Notably, we found significantly higher PFC–M1 SO coupling in the late compared with the early period." p. 2

**Figure 1CD** A coupled slow oscillation (SO) occurs when an M1 SO occurs within 200 ms of a PFC SO. The concentration is higher in the late periods vs early periods of learning. "We found a sharp transition around day 6 in all [rats studied]." p. 2

**Figure 1F** "The transition from low to high PFC–M1 SO coupling occurred as the success rate stabilized." p. 2

### Stepwise drop in M1 SO–SWR coupling

"We next wondered whether the increased PFC–M1 coordination is temporally associated with changes in hippocampus–M1 coordination, as would be predicted for a memory consolidation process in M1 that evolves to become hippocampus-independent." p.3

"To examine temporal links between cross-area coupling transitions, we fit a sigmoid function to each animal’s cross-area coupling. Across six rats, the stepwise dynamics were well predicted by a sigmoid function in ΔSO–SWR coupling in M1 ... and in PFC–M1 SO coupling ... . This increase in PFC–M1 SO coupling—as measured by the midpoint of the sigmoid function fit, that is, the red dot—was followed by a sharp drop in ΔSO– SWR coupling in M1 (blue arrowhead). ... These findings indicate that the full engagement of NREMS PFC–M1 coordination predicts hippocampal–M1 disengagement." pp. 3,4

### Manifold consolidation with drop in SO–SWR coupling

"On the basis of the observed changes in PFC–M1 SO coupling (Fig. 1d), we wondered whether there might be two distinct stages for activity patterns within the M1 manifold. ... we found that between days 5 and 6 was a consistent transition point. This suggested that days 1–5 and days 6–13 represented two periods with distinct rates of change. ... This demarcation revealed an essentially flat slope of approximately zero for days 1–5 (manifold exploration) and then a gradual linear increase trajectory fidelity (manifold consolidation, Fig. 3d,e). Notably, the period of highly variable success rate (Fig. 1f) also appears to be closely related to this transition. Together, these findings raise the possibility that the transition from exploration—associated with variable performance and a low fidelity—to consolidation is temporally linked to changes in PFC–M1 coupling." p. 4

## Discussion

"Our results using skill learning provide insights into the precise spatiotemporal coordination of multiple areas throughout systems consolidation. Our observed task-specific reactivations during early manifold exploration suggest a close link between phase-locking of cortical SOs, hippocampal SWRs and cortical reactivations. These results also suggest that hippocampal SWRs may represent a preserved mechanism of consolidation for both declarative and procedural memories." p. 6

"We found that changes in the variability of task activity were temporally associated with stepwise changes in cross-area coupling. Feedback based on task performance and manifold variability may be a key driver to cease hippocampal learning-related engagement and shifts in coordination. Our results also indicate that dialogue across these systems does not end after systems consolidation. In previous studies, reset of pre-existing connectivity stabilized by consolidation was found to facilitate new learning. It is quite possible that ‘unlearning’ and entering an exploratory state is supported by sleep processing." p. 7
