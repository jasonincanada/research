[Learning cortical representations through perturbed and adversarial dreaming](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.76384) #dep22 (2022) #preprint

"Our results suggest that generating new, virtual sensory inputs via adversarial dreaming during REM sleep is essential for extracting semantic concepts, while replaying episodic memories via perturbed dreaming during NREM sleep improves the robustness of latent representations. The model provides a new computational perspective on sleep states, memory replay and dreams and suggests a cortical implementation of GANs." Abstract

"Here, we propose that dreams, and in particular their creative combination of episodic memories, play an essential role in forming semantic representations over the course of development. ... To support this hypothesis, we introduce a new, functional model of cortical representation learning. The central ingredient of our model is a creative generative process via feedback from higher to lower cortical areas which mimics dreaming during REM sleep." p. 2

### 2.5 Latent organization in healthy and pathological models

"The results so far demonstrate that perturbed and adversarial dreaming (PAD), during REM and NREM sleep states, contribute to cortical representation learning by increasing the linear separability of latent representations into object classes." p. 10

## 3 Discussion

"Here we proposed that creating virtual sensory experiences by randomly combining episodic memories during REM sleep lies at the heart of cortical representation learning." p. 13
