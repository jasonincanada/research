Abstract: "We harnessed the head direction (HD) system of the mouse thalamus, a neuronal population whose activity reports, in awake mice, their actual HD as they explore their environment and, in sleeping mice, their virtual HD. We discovered that the direction and amplitude of rapid eye movements during REM sleep reveal the direction and amplitude of the ongoing changes in virtual HD. Thus, rapid eye movements disclose gaze shifts in the virtual world of REM sleep, thereby providing a window into the cognitive processes of the sleeping brain."

News article: "[Scanziani and Senzai] were able to look at “head direction” cells in the brains of mice, who also experience REM sleep. These cells act something like a compass, and their activity shows researchers which direction the mouse perceives itself as heading.  The team simultaneously recorded data from these cells about the mouse’s heading directions while monitoring its eye movements. Comparing them, they found that the direction of eye movements and of the mouse’s internal compass were **precisely aligned during REM sleep**, just as they do when the mouse is awake and moving around."

[Learning cortical representations through perturbed and adversarial dreaming](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.76384) #dep22 (2022) #preprint

"Our results suggest that generating new, virtual sensory inputs via adversarial dreaming during REM sleep is essential for extracting semantic concepts, while replaying episodic memories via perturbed dreaming during NREM sleep improves the robustness of latent representations. The model provides a new computational perspective on sleep states, memory replay and dreams and suggests a cortical implementation of GANs." Abstract

"Here, we propose that dreams, and in particular their creative combination of episodic memories, play an essential role in forming semantic representations over the course of development. ... To support this hypothesis, we introduce a new, functional model of cortical representation learning. The central ingredient of our model is a creative generative process via feedback from higher to lower cortical areas which mimics dreaming during REM sleep." p. 2

"The results so far demonstrate that perturbed and adversarial dreaming (PAD), during REM and NREM sleep states, contribute to cortical representation learning by increasing the linear separability of latent representations into object classes." p. 10

## 3 Discussion

"Here we proposed that creating virtual sensory experiences by randomly combining episodic memories during REM sleep lies at the heart of cortical representation learning." p. 13
