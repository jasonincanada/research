Highlights from the press release (emphasis in the original):

"[After six years of research](https://viterbi.usc.edu/news/news/2015/scott-fraser-carl-kesselman-don-arnold-imaging-synapses-zebrafish-usc-viterbi-isi.htm), they made the groundbreaking discovery that learning causes synapses, the connections between neurons, to proliferate in some areas and disappear in others rather than merely changing their strength, as commonly thought"

### New Method and Tools

"Prior to their work, it was not possible to determine the location of a synapse in a living brain without modifying its structure and function, making comparisons before and after memory formation unfeasible. ... the teams were able to determine for the first time the strength and location of synapses before and after learning in the brain of a living zebrafish, an animal commonly used to study brain function. ... By keeping the intact fish alive, they were able to compare synapses in the same brain over time, a breakthrough in the neuroscience field."

### Surprising Results

"Rather than the memory causing the strength of existing synapses to change, the synapses in one part of the brain were destroyed and completely new synapses were created in a different region of the brain."

“For the last 40 years the common wisdom was that you learn by changing the _strength_ of the synapses, ... but that’s not what we found in this case.”

“This was the best possible outcome we could have had,” said Arnold, “because we saw this dramatic change in the _number_ of synapses — some disappearing, some forming, and we saw it in a very distinct part of the brain. The dogma was that the synapses change their strength. But I was surprised to see a push-pull phenomenon, and that we didn’t see a change in synapses’ strengths.”
