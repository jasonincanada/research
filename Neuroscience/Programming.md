[Software Bug Detection Causes a Shift From Bottom-Up to Top-Down Effective Connectivity Involving the Insula Within the Error-Monitoring Network](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2022.788272) #cas22 (2022)

### Introduction

"...a recent functional MRI (fMRI) study suggested a pivotal role of the insula during error-monitoring when challenging deep-level analysis of code inspection was required. This raised the hypothesis that the insula is causally involved in deep error-monitoring." p. 1

"Healthy adult programmers participated in this 3T fMRI experiment. The activation maps evoked by error-related events confirmed significant activations in the insula. Importantly, a posterior-to-anterior causality shift was observed concerning the role of the insula: in the absence of error, causal directions were mainly bottom-up, whereas, in their presence, the strong causal top-down effects from frontal regions, in particular, the anterior cingulate cortex [ACC] was observed." p. 1

### Paradigm

Participants were experienced software developers in the C language. They were given four tasks in random order:
- baseline (stare at a cross)
- natural language reading
- a C code snippet with no bugs
- a C code snippet WITH a bug

"To be able to evaluate the true error-related decision moments, the participants were also instructed to select a line as soon as they suspected the presence of a bug (“suspicion/eureka moment”) and to confirm the bug in the button “Bug” when they were sure that there was a fault (“Bug detection”)" p. 2

Researchers recorded fMRI data during these tasks

### Results

"The activation maps for the contrast of the Code with bugs vs. Neutral code (code without bugs) revealed the set of areas responding to the activity of searching for a bug during source-code understanding. In particular, we found activation in the bilateral anterior insula which is a pivotal hub within the salience network, in error-monitoring tasks, in particular, during bug monitoring. This insula activation was even more evident at the “eureka” moment of suspicion when the subject detects a bug in the code (Figure 3)." p. 4

"Taken together, our results suggest that the insula is a pivotal hub concerning reconfiguration of the directionality of the interactions as it becomes the target for an anterior shift of causal influences from frontal error-monitoring and executive function regions when bug detection is required. This region is driven mostly by posterior regions for the natural text reading and controlled by ACC when a very complex task of searching for bugs is required, connecting with frontal regions related to decision-making and error-monitoring within the salience network." p. 4

### Discussion

"Evidence that the insular cortex also seems to be involved in performance monitoring ... and our Granger causality findings showing that error-monitoring-related activity triggers a shift of causal influences to frontal regions, in particular, ACC, make a strong basis toward the notion that the insula is a pivotal region during error-monitoring." p. 5
