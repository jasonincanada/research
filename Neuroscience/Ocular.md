[Stochastic Physiological Gaze-Evoked Nystagmus With Slow Centripetal Drift During Fixational Eye Movements at Small Gaze Eccentricities](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2022.842883) #oza22 (2022)

- while attempting to fix their gaze on a target, the eyes still move involuntarily
- movements are composed of two separate components: a random-walk component called drifts-tremor (DRT) and a ballistic component, sudden small jumps, called microsaccades (MS)
- DRT drift happens continuously in the intervals between MS jumps and is centripetal, ie, it wants to drift back toward the center of the field of view
- MS jumps happen about twice a second with a mean jump of ~0.3° and are centrifugal, ie, away from what would be the center of the eyeballs' field of view, in order to correct back to the attempted fixation point (usually overshooting and rolling back quickly, though the data was smoothed to remove this extra motion, leaving an instantaneous jump; see Figure 3 bottom right)

Participants sat in front of a white screen with a small fixation target placed at one of five horizontal positions (centered vertically for each): center, to the left/right by ~7.8° and to the left/right by 15.2°.  Eyeball orientations were sampled at 500 Hz while participants attempted to keep their gaze fixated on the target for 35 s

**Figure 4** Shows the eyes' involuntary movement components broken out into DRT drift (green), MS jumps (red), and both combined (blue). Dotted lines show linear fits to the data. Time flows forward from top down.  There's a clear trend showing that the cummulative sum of slow gradual drifts (green) are centripetal--inwards back toward the middle of the field of vision. The microsaccade jumps trend outwards centrifugally back to the point of fixation.  These combine (blue) to keep the gaze more or less fixated on the target
