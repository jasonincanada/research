[Exogenous capture accounts for fundamental differences between pro- and antisaccade performance](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.76964) #gol22 (2022)

- primates' oculomotor system selects a target to look at every 200–250 ms
- two components of attention:
    - *exogenous*: automatic response to size/luminance/motion of objects in view
    - *endogenous*: internal behaviour goals (ie: participant is told to look toward or away from cue)
- study looks at the tension between the two and the dependence of exo on endo, if any

"In the urgent antisaccade experiment, the tachometric curve revealed a unique feature: a range of processing times roughly between 90 and 130 ms in which performance plummeted to nearly 0% correct (Figure 2d). In other words, there was a range of conditions (i.e., states of motor preparation) indexed by processing time over which the cue onset would almost inevitably capture the saccade and lead to an error. Thereafter, for rPT ≳140 ms, accuracy increased steadily and reached nearly 100% correct." p. 2

**Figure 2** Note the dip in the red plot (d). Between ~90ms and ~140ms after cue onset the accuracy in the antisaccade task drops almost to 0; the eyes' focus is "captured" by the exogenous stimulus regardless of the participant's plan to look away from it

"We interpreted these data as the direct manifestation of the conflict between the early attentional pull toward the cue, which is salience-driven, involuntary, and transient, and the later intention to look away, which is task-dependent, voluntary, and sustained." p. 3

Same effect across all 10 participants:

**Figure 6 a,b** Accuracy as a function of rPT (raw processing time, from cue onset to saccade toward/away from goal, see Fig 1) for anti- (a) and pro- (b) saccades

- study concludes the exogenous response is "highly stereotyped and largely independent of behavioral context." p. 3

"In summary, then, we found that the capture mechanism is the same in the urgent pro- and antisaccade tasks, and that it is the consequence of a robust exogenous burst of oculomotor activity that always occurs. Therefore, it remains to be determined whether antisaccade performance depends critically on a specific circuit element being inhibited, but the obvious candidate, the exogenous response itself, is not it." p. 11

[Stochastic Physiological Gaze-Evoked Nystagmus With Slow Centripetal Drift During Fixational Eye Movements at Small Gaze Eccentricities](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2022.842883) #oza22 (2022)

- while attempting to fix their gaze on a target, the eyes still move involuntarily
- movements are composed of two separate components: a random-walk component called drifts-tremor (DRT) and a ballistic component, sudden small jumps, called microsaccades (MS)
- DRT drift happens continuously in the intervals between MS jumps and is centripetal, ie, it wants to drift back toward the center of the field of view
- MS jumps happen about twice a second with a mean jump of ~0.3° and are centrifugal, ie, away from what would be the center of the eyeballs' field of view, in order to correct back to the attempted fixation point (usually overshooting and rolling back quickly, though the data was smoothed to remove this extra motion, leaving an instantaneous jump; see Figure 3 bottom right)

Participants sat in front of a white screen with a small fixation target placed at one of five horizontal positions (centered vertically for each): center, to the left/right by ~7.8° and to the left/right by 15.2°.  Eyeball orientations were sampled at 500 Hz while participants attempted to keep their gaze fixated on the target for 35 s

**Figure 3** Right side of Fig 3 showing two MS jumps in the vertical grey bars, and DRT drift in green in the intervals between jumps. Top is raw data and bottom is the same but with the MS data smoothed into an instantaneous jump

![[oza22 fig 4 - cummulative movement slopes.png]]

**Figure 4** Shows the eyes' involuntary movement components broken out into DRT drift (green), MS jumps (red), and both combined (blue). Dotted lines show linear fits to the data. Time flows forward from top down.  There's a clear trend showing that the cummulative sum of slow gradual drifts (green) are centripetal--inwards back toward the middle of the field of vision. The microsaccade jumps trend outwards centrifugally back to the point of fixation.  These combine (blue) to keep the gaze more or less fixated on the target
