[Visual and linguistic semantic representations are aligned at the border of human visual cortex](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-021-00921-6) (2021)
* Visual and linguistic representations are *aligned in the brain*
* "Remarkably, the pattern of semantic selectivity in these two distinct networks corresponded along the boundary of visual cortex: for visual categories represented posterior to the boundary, **the same categories were represented linguistically on the anterior side**. These results suggest that these two networks are smoothly joined to form one contiguous map." (Abstract)
