[A petavoxel fragment of human cerebral cortex reconstructed at nanoscale resolution](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adk4858) #sha24 (2024)

"Our analysis showed that glia outnumber neurons 2:1, oligodendrocytes were the most common cell, deep layer excitatory neurons could be classified on the basis of dendritic orientation, and among thousands of weak connections to each neuron, there exist rare powerful axonal inputs of up to 50 synapses."
