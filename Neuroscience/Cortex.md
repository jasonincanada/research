[Large-scale cortical functional networks are organized in structured cycles](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-025-02052-8) #van25 (2025)

"Here we studied the temporal evolution of canonical, large-scale, cortical functional networks that are thought to underlie cognition. We showed that, although network dynamics are stochastic, the overall ordering of their activity **forms a robust cyclical pattern**." (Abstract)

- brain in wakeful resting state
- reproduced in 5 independent datasets

"Using hidden Markov modeling, the analysis identified $K = 12$ states, reflecting distinct brain networks with unique spatial configurations of power and coherence that reoccur at different points in time." p. 2

"This revealed that certain network states (5 and 9) tend to occur after state 1, whereas other states (2, 8) tend to occur before state 1. All other states (3, 6, 7, 10, 11 and 12) did not exhibit significant asymmetrical activation probability ..." p. 2

**Figure 1c** If there was no pattern in the state transitions these would all be white or light pink/blue. The bolder colors show some states tend to precede or follow other states

- they form a cycle!

"We confirmed that the cyclical pattern, as a result of all FO asymmetries together, could not have arisen by chance by permuting network state labels within each participant." p. 3

**Figure 2d** The state transitions form an overarching cycle

- cycles are strongest over the timescale of seconds (p. 4)
- "... together they produced a robust cyclical pattern of cortical network activations on timescales of 300–1,000 ms" p. 2

"The first major mode of differentiation between network states emerges on the north–south axis of the clock face. States in the upper quadrant have a higher overall power and interarea coherence (that is, phase locking). States 1 and 3, in particular, show strong overlap with areas overlapping the DMN (including bilateral inferior parietal lobe, medial prefrontal cortex and medial temporal lobe). This is not a mere broadband power increase, but rather reflects different combinations of oscillatory activity in distinct or overlapping frequency bands. On the lower quadrant, states have lower overall power and interarea coherence, particularly in sensorimotor and parietal areas. These states are associated with sensorimotor processing (states 9 and 12) and the DAN." p. 4

"A second mode of differentiation emerges on the east-west axis of the clock face. In terms of spectral activity, network states on the left of the quadrant display activity in higher-frequency bands, for instance, state 6 is associated with β-band (14–30 Hz) activity and state 2 with α-band (7–13 Hz) activity. On the other hand, states on the right-hand side show activity in lower-frequency bands, particularly the δ (1–4 Hz) and θ (4–7 Hz) bands. Spatially, states on the left-hand side show increased low-frequency activity in sensorimotor and parietal areas, which are associated with sensorimotor inhibition. Meanwhile, states on the right-hand side show activity mostly in frontotemporal and language areas." p. 6

- cycle strength reliably predicted age, but not sex (p. 6)
- strong evidence that cycle rate, but not cycle strength, is heritable (p. 6)

**Figure 5f** Monozygotic (same egg) twins have more similar cycle rates than dizygotic twins (2 eggs, more like regular siblings) ($P = .0039$)

"Our analysis showed that glia outnumber neurons 2:1, oligodendrocytes were the most common cell, deep layer excitatory neurons could be classified on the basis of dendritic orientation, and among thousands of weak connections to each neuron, there exist rare powerful axonal inputs of up to 50 synapses."
