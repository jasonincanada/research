[Rotating waves during human sleep spindles organize global patterns of activity that repeat precisely through the night](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17267) (2016)

"We show here that cortical spindles are spatiotemporally organized into circular wave-like patterns, organizing neuronal activity over tens of milliseconds, within the timescale for storing memories in large-scale networks across the cortex via spike-time dependent plasticity. These circular patterns repeat over hours of sleep with millisecond temporal precision, allowing reinforcement of the activity patterns through hundreds of reverberations." (Abstract)

Spindle frequency: 11-15 Hz
