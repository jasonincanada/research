[Contextual and pure time coding for self and other in the hippocampus](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-022-01226-y) #ome22 (2022)

- time cells in bat hippocampus (dCA1) form two distinct populations:
    - one depending on where the bat is spatially in the environment (contextual time cells)
    - the other independent of location, encoding purely elapsed time
- time cells encode sequences aligned to others in the environment (social)

### Two distinct neural populations: contextual and pure time cells

"Do hippocampal time cells encode context-dependent time sequences or, rather, represent time per se?" p. 3

Visual inspection showed two subsets of time cells:

(1) "Most of the time cells (64.7%, 123/190) were significantly time tuned only in one particular location while completely losing their time preference when the bat was in either of the other two locations. ... We called these neurons ‘contextual time cells’."

**Figure 3a** Three example time cells in the same bat, showing firing or non-firing patterns depending on which ball it had landed on

(2) "The remaining time cells were significantly time tuned in more than one location. These cells tended to show a similar time preference irrespective of the bat’s location (35.3% of all the time cells ...) Thus, these were ‘pure’ time cells, which represented elapsed time in an abstract manner, irrespective of place or context."

**Figure 3a** Fourth row of figure shows firing responses of one time cell in the same bat at more than one location

"We separated the time cells into two non-overlapping groups: time cells that were tuned significantly on both A *and* B (Fig. 4a) and time cells that were tuned significantly on A *or* B but not both (Fig. 4b). We observed that the time sequences of cells tuned on A *and* B remained similar in both locations after sorting the cells based on their time tuning on the opposite landing ball ... This observation further suggested that the time tuning of cells tuned on A *and* B tended to be similar in different locations. We note that having a similar time preference in different locations is non-trivial, because here, the distinction between contextual and pure time cells was based on whether a cell is tuned on A *or* B versus whether it is tuned on both A *and* B—and, a priori, based on this selection criterion, there is no reason that a time cell active in both locations should have a similar time preference, as exhibited here by the pure time cells. Therefore, the conserved time tuning of pure time cells is quite surprising." pp. 3,4

### Time cells for other individuals

"Finally, we asked whether there are time cells in the hippocampus that encode elapsed time from the landing moment of the other bat. Surprisingly, we found time cells for the other bat, with significant and reliable transient firing at a specific time relative to the landing moment of the other bat. ... A total of 56 out of the 391 recorded neurons (14.3%) were significant time cells for the other." p. 7

### Discussion

"Our study revealed four main findings:" p. 9

"(1) First, to our knowledge, this is the first report on two distinct bimodal populations of time cells (in this case, pure and contextual time cells)."

"(2) Second, this is the first study that found different time coding by time cells in different locations within the same environment. Previous studies reported on time cells in completely different spatial contexts but not in different locations within the same environment."

"(3) Third, the intriguing pure time cells, which encoded time per se, not linked to any behavioral sequence or context, provide, to our knowledge, the first example, in any species, of neurons that purely encode elapsed time."

"(4) Fourth, another surprising result is the finding of cells encoding elapsed time for another individual; such cells were not reported to date. ... the present work is the first to show internally generated sequences relative to the behavior of another agent, in a social context. These internally generated sequences
    (i) may represent elapsed time for the other or
    (ii) may represent sequential activity of self time cells that was triggered by an external cue or sensory stimulus—such as the sight or sound of the other bat’s landing or by the increased rate of the other’s biosonar signals as it landed.
    (iii) Or, perhaps, these internally generated sequences represent memory of self landing that was retrieved upon the other bat’s landing. Although we cannot dissociate these possibilities, in all these cases the trigger for the sequence was an event ‘out there’ rather than the behavior of the implanted bat itself. Importantly, to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of time cell sequences in the mammalian hippocampus that are triggered by an external action of another conspecific and, thus, constitute an explicit temporal representation of elapsed time for another individual." p. 9
