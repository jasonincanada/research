[Anterior Cingulate Cortex Signals the Need to Control Intrusive Thoughts During Motivated Forgetting](https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1711-21.2022) #gar22 (2022) #preprint

## Introduction

"Suppressing unwanted memories engages the dACC [dorsal anterior cingulate cortex], but its contribution to inhibitory control over memory remains unclear. ... The conflict monitoring theory proposes that dACC is sensitive to cognitive conflict ... Accounts derived from the predicted response outcome model (PRO) point out that surprising events typically increase the activation of this region, so they maintain that dACC plays a specific role in calculating surprise." p. 4

"Following these ideas, we hypothesized that, during motivated forgetting, dACC dynamically regulates mnemonic inhibition by computing signals that indicate a need to control unwelcome content. On one hand, these warning signals may originate from reminders that foreshadow an unwanted memory’s intrusion, triggering proactive control to prevent retrieval; on the other hand, they may derive directly from an unwanted memory’s reactivation, which may elicit cognitive conflict and a need to purge the intruding memory from mind." p. 4

"We hypothesized that dACC transmits these proactive and reactive signals to rDLPFC [right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex] to amplify top-down inhibition over regions driving retrieval of the offending memory." p. 4

## Paradigm

Participants memorized pairs of words, then were tested on recall of the second word of a pair when shown the first. If the cue word had a green box around it, the subject tried to recall the word that had been paired with it. But if the cue word had a red box around it, the subject was to deliberately try *not* to recall the associated word. In the meantime, researchers recorded EEG and fMRI data to watch the dynamics between various brain regions of interest (dACC, rDLPFC, hippocampus)


## Results

Summarizing this long section by copying the subsection headings, with specific notes as sub-nodes below them

**Early engagement of dACC’s theta control mechanism predicts reduced demands on dACC and rDLPFC for intrusion control** p. 22
- "People who see a reminder to an unwanted thought and engage inhibitory control early enough may prevent the unwelcome memory from intruding. Achieving this form of proactive control requires a mechanism that detects the need for increased control upon seeing a reminder. In natural settings, people may learn to identify warning features of stimuli that foreshadow unpleasant thoughts and use these features to initiate proactive suppression. We hypothesized that one of the key roles of dACC during motivated forgetting is to trigger this proactive mechanism to entirely prevent awareness of unwelcome content."

**Delayed dACC responses during suppression trigger increased communication with rDLPFC through a theta mechanism** p. 31
- "Once an intrusion is detected, the need for increased control should be transmitted to prefrontal areas that implement mnemonic inhibition. We hypothesized that dACC communicates an intrusion-control signal to rDLPFC through a mechanism of interareal neural coupling mediated by theta band activity."
- "We expected that, if dACC and rDLPFC were particularly engaged in control processes triggered by intrusions, these regions should show activity differences significantly larger than those shown prior to cue onset. Agreeing with this, two frontal clusters exhibited above-baseline effects: one in the right hemisphere comprising superior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus and ACC, and another in the left hemisphere comprising inferior frontal gyrus and insula."
- "Our results support our hypothesis, showing that dACC and rDLPFC were maximally engaged around the time that unwanted memories may have been retrieved. Strikingly, stronger responses in dACC generated Granger causal influences on rDLPFC activity within the theta and alpha frequency bands, consistent with a process communicating the need to intensify memory control."

**Early control processes involving dACC contribute to later hippocampal downregulation** p. 32
- "An intruding memory may not endure very long in awareness if inhibitory mechanisms already have been prepared when intrusions occur. We hypothesized that proactive control early in the trial would facilitate the later down-regulation of memory-related networks, and that theta oscillatory activity associated with retrieval should reflect the impact of suppression."
- "We focused on theta-band activity because abundant animal and human literature shows that retrieval depends on hippocampal-cortical synchronization supported by the theta rhythm."
- "Consistent with our hypothesis, the greatest reduction in theta was localized in the left hippocampus ... but both hippocampi showed theta power decreases in ROI TFR analyses."
- "These findings indicate that early control processes contributed to the later stopping of hippocampal retrieval, consistent with a potential benefit of proactive control."
- "To verify the localization of these effects to the hippocampus, we performed several additional analyses. ... Together, these parallel findings strongly support our hypothesis that dACC triggers proactive inhibitory control to stop retrieval of unwanted memories by the hippocampus."

**RDLPFC down-regulates the hippocampus in response to late dACC control signals** p. 36
-  "The foregoing findings suggest an account in which early and delayed control mechanisms during memory suppression contribute to hippocampal down-regulation, which is expressed as theta power decreases. By this interpretation, when early control fails to prevent unwanted memories from intruding, dACC generates signals indicating the need for intrusion-control. These signals may dynamically adjust inhibitory control mechanisms in the rDLPFC to downregulate hippocampal activity to purge the intruding memories."
- "Together, these findings point to a late influence of the rDLPFC on the hippocampus and suggest that beta oscillations mediate a reactive top-down inhibitory control mechanism triggered in response to intrusions detected by the dACC."


## Discussion

"Our findings reveal a central role of dACC in triggering inhibitory control that causes motivated forgetting. The data suggest that dACC signals the need for inhibition proactively, in response to environmental cues, or reactively, to counter intrusive thoughts." p. 38

"Importantly, our results suggest that proactive control did not simply prevent retrieval but also facilitated forgetting." p. 39

"Our findings suggest that dACC detects conflict caused by intruding memories and communicates the need for control to rDLPFC, which in turn increases top-down inhibition over the hippocampus." p. 40

"Taken together with the current results, these findings point to a key role of beta oscillations in the top-down control over hippocampal processing by rDLPFC, a demand that is especially acute during the reactive control of intrusions." p. 41

"In summary, this study provides evidence that theta mechanisms in dACC are key to triggering inhibitory control by rDLPFC during motivated forgetting. These mechanisms can be engaged rapidly by external warning stimuli, helping to rapidly pre-empt unwanted thoughts. Additionally, they are strongly activated during a later time window after hippocampal retrieval likely has occurred, consistent with a reactive control response to intrusions that enhances hippocampal downregulation by the rDLPFC. This impact of PFC on hippocampal activity is achieved by rDLPFC-hippocampal beta interactions critical to clearing the mind from unwanted thoughts and to hastening the demise of memories we would prefer not to have." p. 42
