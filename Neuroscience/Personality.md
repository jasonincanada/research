"... We collected genome-wide expression profiles of adults to characterize the regulation of expression and function in genes related to human personality. ... We discovered that interactions between the two [regulatory gene] networks were coordinated by a control hub of 3 miRNAs and 3 protein-coding genes shared by both. ... We conclude that the six-gene hub is the crux of an integrative network that orchestrates information-transfer throughout a multi-modular system of over 4000 genes ..." (Abstract)

**Figure 3c** "Integration of T-SAER and T-SASC minimum networks into an 82 genes network (called T-SAER-SASC) by the six shared genes in the central axis." I added the blue oval to highlight the six genes central to the network--the subgraphs to the left and right don't connect to each other except through these six nodes

## Discussion

"We found that personality is associated with a molecular integration network that regulates multiple specialized functional modules that turn one another on and off via reciprocal interactions." p. 13

"Specifically, we compared the regulation of gene expression in people with three levels of self-aware consciousness:
    (i) “unregulated”: people with little or no self-awareness (i.e., emotionally reactive and motivated primarily their habits, traditions, and irrational desires
    (ii) “organized”: egocentric and materialistic individuals who learn by using intentional self-control to regulate their habits and to set self-serving goals using their analytical intellect, and
    (iii) “creative”: allocentric and self-transcendent individuals who use self-awareness to perceive how to live in meaningful harmony with others, nature, or the universe as an inseparable aspect of a greater whole.

"We confirmed our prediction that regulation of gene expression was strongly influenced by self-awareness (creative > organized > unregulated), ..." p. 13
