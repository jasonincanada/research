The above figure is from [Cerebellar Development and Circuit Maturation: A Common Framework for Spinocerebellar Ataxias](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2020.00293) (2020). The section **The Cerebellum** has a good overview, and note the sentence ending "... however, CaCs targets and inputs still remain elusive." has been followed up by [Candelabrum cells are ubiquitous cerebellar cortex interneurons with specialized circuit properties](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-022-01057-x) (2022) which describes this cell and its connections in detail.  Note that candelabrum cells are not represented in the microcircuitry diagram taken from Wikipedia above
