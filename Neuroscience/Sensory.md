- "... circuits of touch and sight are not independent in the embryo, but are intermingled. It is at birth when these circuits separate and responses to sensory stimuli become independent."
- "... during embryonic development a tactile stimulus not only triggers the expected response in the primary somatosensory cortex (one of the areas of the brain that deals with the sense of touch), but surprisingly also gives rise to a response in the primary visual cortex of both hemispheres."
- "This fundamental process of separation of sensory circuits occurs during a window of time close to birth, in a brain structure called the superior colliculus."
- this is dependent on activity from the retina and is delayed without it, leading to long term defects
