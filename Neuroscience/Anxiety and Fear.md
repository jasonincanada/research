[Anxious individuals shift emotion control from lateral frontal pole to dorsolateral prefrontal cortex](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-40666-3) #bra23 (2023)

"There are three main findings" p. 6

- "First, anxious individuals use dlPFC [dorsolateral prefrontal cortex], rather than FPl [lateral frontal pole] as their non-anxious peers, to implement control over emotional action tendencies."
- "Second, FPl in anxious individuals might receive stronger input from the amygdala via more extensive amygdalofugal pathway connections, and the magnitude of that structural connection predicts the degree of FPl-dlPFC shift during the implementation of emotional control."
- "Third, FPl in anxious individuals is highly excitable, and the excitation/inhibition balance of that region becomes decoupled from behavioral and neural indices of emotional action control, whereas those structure-function relationships are observed in non-anxious individuals."

"In summary, we show that, in humans, anxiety is associated with inefficient involvement of FPl during emotional control. We provide evidence for a functional anatomical shift in the implementation of emotional control in anxious individuals, from FPl to dlPFC. This functional anatomical shift is linked to changes in the strength of amygdalofugal projections to FPl and complemented by FPl overexcitability." p. 7
