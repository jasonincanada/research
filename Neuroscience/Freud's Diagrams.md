"There is an obvious progression in the drawings. The first group, dating from 1876, depicts in meticulous detail the morphology of specific anatomical structures, such as the gonads of the eel, the spinal neurons of the lamprey and the fiber pathways of the human brain. The last drawings, dating to 1933, by contrast, are diagrammatic depictions of abstractions such as the “ego”, “superego” and “id” — conceptual entities that have no tangible existence in the physical world." p. 13

"Of critical importance in this regard is the bald fact that functions cannot be seen; they have to be deduced. This does not make functions any less real than structures. They lack direct observability because they are dynamic things; they only exist over time — they involve processes. And such things cannot be easily drawn." p. 15

## bolstering Darwin

"Freud was able to show that a continuous series of subtle changes linked the nervous systems of invertebrates and vertebrates. Previously it was believed that a sharp anatomical division separated these two classes of animal. In other words, Freud discovered something of a “missing link” in this study. He thereby contributed to the great pool of data which finally established in the scientific community the conviction of the evolutionary continuity of all organisms" p. 63

## first to identify the neuron

"In these drawings Freud depicted the essential unity of cell and fiber. This paved the way for the neuron doctrine. Unfortunately the way in which Freud presented his conclusions was too cautious and reserved for him to actually be credited with the discovery of the neuron — and a full seven years would pass before Wilhelm von Waldeyer-Hartz and Santiago Ramón y Cajal formally proclaimed its existence." p. 69

"This was Freud’s last primary anatomical research paper. From this point onward, his anatomical writings become increasingly abstract and theoretical." p. 83

"The most important novelty was the idea that *the body periphery is not projected onto the cortex in a simple and direct fashion*, as Freud’s teacher Theodor Meynert had supposed it was, but rather it is *represented* there. In other words, the relationship between body and cortex is not topological but *functional*." p. 91

"It is no exaggeration to say that this insight is the precise point at which the *mind* — that aspect of the organism which represents the body not concretely but rather *functionally, abstractly and symbolically* — entered Freud’s scientific work." p. 91

From p. 2 of [Psychoanalysis and Neuroscience: The Bridge Between Mind and Brain](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.01983):

> In his Project [for a Scientific Psychology], Freud tried to explain at various levels the physiological basis of memory, hypothesizing that one of the neurophysiological prerequisites necessary for this function was a system of barriers, which he named “contact-barrier.” He used this term to describe the neurophysiological entity which 11 years later, Charles Scott Sherrington named synapses.

## departure from neuroanatomy

![[freud - word presentation.png]]
"Psychological diagram of the word presentation." Freud's first drawing of a purely psychological (not anatomical) entity.

    "The word presentation is shown as a closed complex of presentations, whereas the object presentation is shown as an open one. The word presentation is not linked to the object presentation by all its constituent elements, but only by its sound image. Among the object associations, it is the visual ones which stand for the object, in the same way as the sound image stands for the word. The connections linking the word sound image with object associations other than the visual ones are not indicated."

"Freud would never again concern himself with the concrete structure of the brain. Henceforth his approach was always *functional* and *dynamic*. Consider the following passage from *The Interpretation of Dreams* in the light of this drawing:" p. 96

    "Ideas, thoughts and psychical structures in general must never be regarded as localized *in* organic elements of the nervous system but rather, as one might say, *between* them, where resistances and facilitations provide the corresponding correlates"
    
This idea finds an echo in any intermediate category theory text which implores its readers to concentrate less on objects and instead on the morphisms between them. See Milewski's post [It's All About Morphisms](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2015/11/17/its-all-about-morphisms/)

## Project for a Scientific Psychology (1895)

"The “Project” and the Fliess correspondence contained Freud’s final attempts to conceptualize the functions of the mind in neurological terms" p. 101

![[freud - quantity complexity.png]]

Freud: "*Quantity* in phi is expressed by *complexity* in psi."

"This schematic drawing ... is divided vertically into two sections: the left half, which contains the cell body of a neuron, is part of the phi (perceptual) system of the brain; and the right half, which contains the terminal branches of its axon, is part of the psi (memory) system. The drawing depicts Freud’s inference that phi energies are widely distributed in the psi system, thereby protecting it from excessive stimuli." p. 101

![[freud - lateral cathexis and inhibition.png]]

Freud: "A ‘lateral’ cathexis thus acts as *an inhibition on the passage of quantity.*"

"This famous drawing ... depicts another way in which Freud envisaged psi neurons dealing with the threat of excessive stimulation, namely through inhibition. By a mechanism called “side cathexis,” Freud imagined that energy could be inhibited by being diverted away from psi (mnemic) neurons which would, if activated, generate feelings of unpleasure (due to their associative connections)." p. 103

Modern research:  A 2021 study found that chandelier cells synapse exclusively onto the axon-initial-segment of pyramidal neurons (in mouse visual cortex): [Structure and function of axo-axonic inhibition](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.73783).  From the abstract: "Biophysical simulations show that the observed pattern of axo-axonic inhibition is particularly effective in controlling excitatory output when excitation and inhibition are co-active."

![[freud - ucs links.png]]

Freud: "Unconscious intermediate links."

![[freud - dream and trauma.png]]

"These drawings ... depict a dream and a traumatic memory respectively. The black dots represent associations that generate *conscious* awareness; the white ones are *unconscious* intermediate links. It is noteworthy that anatomical detail is no longer necessary for Freud to portray the functional mechanisms that underpin such complex processes." p. 107

## associative links

![[freud - associative links.png]]

"This drawing ... depicts associative links between various conscious, preconscious and unconscious word presentations" p. 121


## the limits of diagrams

![[freud - limits of diagrams.png]]

Freud: "Unfortunately this technical device is not sufficiently pliable for our purpose, or possibly we have not yet learned to use it with effect. In any case I hope the reader will not expect too much from it."

"The “technical device” to which Freud refers here is *diagrammatic representation itself*. It is clear from this statement why drawings became increasingly rare in Freud’s writings as he made the transition from neuroanatomy to psychoanalysis; the processes he was concerned with became progressively more complex, dynamic and abstract, and therefore less amenable to visual modes of representation." p. 123

## group psychology

![[freud - group psychology.png]]

Freud: “*A primary group … is a number of individuals who have put one and the same object in the place of their ego ideal and have consequently identified themselves with one another in their ego*. This condition admits of graphic representation.”

"This diagram is unique among Freud’s drawings in so far as it attempts to represent relations between the major mental systems (or agencies) in a group of human minds." p. 125

## psychical apparatus

| German     | English                                  |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| überich    | superego                                 |
| ich        | ego                                      |

| verdrängt  | repression                               |
| W-Bw       | perception-consciousness system (p. 127) |
| vorbewusst | preconscious                             |
| unbewusst  | unconscious                              |

Freud: "I should like to portray the structural relations of the mental personality, as I have described it to you, in the unassuming sketch which I now present you with. As you see here, the superego merges into the id; indeed as heir to the Oedipus complex it has intimate relations with the id; it is more remote than the ego from the perceptual system. The id has intercourse with the external world only through the ego – at least, according to the diagram. It is certainly hard to say today how far the drawing is correct. In one respect it is undoubtedly not. The space occupied by the unconscious id ought to have been incomparably greater than that of the ego or the preconscious. I must ask you to correct this in your thoughts.”
