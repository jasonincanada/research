It's here!  And they added **four further** proofs!

Section 5 divulges the insight they used to find their new proofs:

**Lemma 1**.
    *a) If ABC is an isosceles right triangle (so that $\alpha = \beta = 45$) then the only triangle whose angles are integral linear combinations of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ is the isosceles right triangle.*
    *b) If $\alpha < \beta$ in right triangle ABC, then there exists a right triangle whose acute angles are $2\alpha$ and $\beta - \alpha$. Furthermore, $2\alpha$ and $\beta - \alpha$ are the only integral linear combinations of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ that will form the acute angles of a right triangle for every pair $\{\alpha, \beta\}$.*

"... we restricted our creation of new triangles to the ones whose angles are integral sums and/or differences of $\Delta$ABC’s three angles $\alpha$, $\beta$, and 90 ($= \alpha + \beta$) degrees." p. 749

"Our lemma told us exactly how to look for proofs of the Pythagorean theorem (for non-isosceles right triangles): starting with our original triangle *ABC* we tried to create in as many ways as possible a new right triangle whose angles measure $2\alpha$, $\beta − \alpha$, and 90 degrees." p. 749

 "This simple method produced a number of new proofs, ﬁve of which are shown above while ﬁve (or more) are left for the interested reader to discover." p. 750
