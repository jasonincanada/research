[Learning at your brain’s rhythm: individualized entrainment boosts learning for perceptual decisions](https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhac426) #mic22 (2022)

## Intro

- alpha band (8-12 Hz) brain oscillations relate to perceptual task performance. amplitude and phase both act to gate perception
- briefly presented stimuli more likely to be detected at particular phases of alpha cycle
- recent research using entrainment (rhythmic stimulation—visual flickering—at a certain frequency) tested the link between alpha oscillations and performance
- but those tests used the same fixed frequency across all participants
- this study tested whether individuals have a preferred peak alpha frequency, a personal rate of perceptual information processing

"Here, we ask whether entraining the brain at individualized alpha frequencies boosts individual learning ability. ... We hypothesized that entrainment at an individualized—compared to non-individualized—alpha frequency would boost learning ability. Further, we tested whether learning depends on the oscillatory phase of stimulus presentation (peak vs. trough) and whether entrainment frequency and phase interact to support improved performance due to training. ... Our results demonstrate that entrainment at an individualized alpha frequency results in faster learning." p. 2

## Method

The study used visual entrainment (flickering) of a white square, and Glass patterns shown at different times relative to the participants' alpha oscillations to test perceptual learning over time.

- participant's individual alpha rate was measured by resting-state EEG prior to task training
- 15 flickers of a solid white square relative to alpha rate to induce entrainment
- short pause with blank interval for 1-3 or 1.5-3.5 alpha cycles
- Glass pattern presented for 200ms
- participants then signalled whether it was a concentric or radial Glass pattern

**Figure 1C** Entrainment frequency matched to alpha (shown) or offset by ±1 Hz (not shown). After a delay, the Glass pattern was shown either at the peak of the alpha wave or trough and offset by 1, 2, or 3 cycles (or 1.5, 2.5, 3.5)

Participants were divided into 4 groups based on changing or not changing the entrainment frequency relative to their IAF (individual alpha frequency):

| Group            | Description                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P-Match (PM)     | Entrainment flicker matched the subject's IAF, Glass pattern presented at **peak** of wave           |
| T-Match (TM)     | Entrainment flicker matched, but pattern presented at **trough** of wave                             |
| T-nonMatch (TnM) | Flicker offset from IAF by +1 Hz or -1 Hz (kept the same between trials within a particular subject) |
| T-Match Control  | Randomized inter-flash intervals during entrainment                                                  |

Note on missing P-nonMatch: "However, for the nonMatch group, performance was assessed at the Trough phase only, as individual frequency-matched entrainment at the Trough phase was expected to show stronger behavioral improvement than entrainment at the Peak phase based on previous work ... ." p. 3

## Results

"We found that individualized alpha entrainment with stimuli presented at the trough of the alpha phase accelerated learning (Fig. 2); that is, individuals in the T-Match group showed the fastest learning rates [compared to] individuals at the PM and TnM groups ... These results suggest that individualized alpha entrainment enhances learning, but only when stimuli are presented at the trough rather than the peak of the induced oscillations." p. 5

## Discussion

"... we demonstrate that individualized alpha entrainment boosts our ability to improve perceptual decisions through training and facilitates early processing in the visual cortex. In particular, we show that brain entrainment accelerates learning when stimulating individuals at their own brain state (i.e. alpha oscillation frequency) in a phase-specific manner (i.e. the target stimulus is aligned to the trough rather than the peak of the entrainment phase). Our findings advance our understanding of the role of brain states in individualized learning for improved cognitive skills in the following main respects." p. 8

"First, ... we extend beyond previous work showing that training alters alpha power ..., demonstrating a benefit of individualized alpha frequency entrainment on learning ability; that is, entraining at IAF, as measured by resting state EEG, accelerates learning. ... we provide evidence that entraining the brain at an individual’s dominant frequency at rest boosts learning, while misaligning the entrainment frequency from the IAF (i.e. introducing ±1 Hz frequency shift) reduces the efficacy of the entrainment and any learning benefit." p. 8

"Second, we demonstrate that individualized entrainment resulted in increased alpha power during entrainment, validating that flicker-induced stimulation drives alpha oscillations. ... Our results showing enhanced pre-stimulus alpha, but limited learning for the PM compared to the TM group, suggest that increase in alpha power alone may not be sufficient for learning." p. 8

"Furthermore, we provide evidence that phase alignment of the target stimulus to the entrainment frequency is critical for faster learning, suggesting that phase gating plays a key role in learning. ... Here, we demonstrate that individualized alpha entrainment boosts learning only when the task-relevant stimulus is aligned to the trough—rather than the peak—of the flicker-induced alpha frequency." pp. 8, 9

"Finally, we provide evidence that individualized alpha entrainment alters early visual processing (i.e. early visual evoked responses measured with EEG) to support improved perceptual decisions through training. ... These results suggest that individualized alpha entrainment enhances attentional selection of target features and optimizes their processing in the visual cortex to support efficient target detection and identification." p. 10

"In sum, combining flicker-induced entrainment with EEG, we demonstrate that individuals learn faster when learning at their own brain rhythm (i.e. IAF). It is likely that visual flicker induces a widespread entrainment across brain regions." p. 10
