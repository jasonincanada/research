The footage collected by the team shows the wild octopuses hurling different items in different scenarios, and at times hitting other octopuses with them.

In some circumstances, the octopuses could be seen throwing away the scraps of their meals or other materials in an apparent attempt to tidy up their living space. In another case, a female octopus repeatedly hurled silt at a male octopus that had tried to mate with her, who dodged the incoming projectiles. The scientists also saw the octopuses throw silt at one of the research cameras, while other throws hit nearby fish.

“Most throws do not hit others,” said Professor Peter Godfrey-Smith, lead author of the research. “Only a minority of cases appear to be targeted. I’d speculate that a lot of the targeted throws are more like an attempt to establish some ‘personal space,’ but this is a speculation, it’s very hard to know what their goals might be.”
