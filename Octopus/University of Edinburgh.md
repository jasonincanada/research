Rather than pull a lever to receive sardines, Albert would busy himself trying to break the lever clean off by wrestling with it for hours, or spend his time repeatedly spraying one particular researcher he didn’t seem to like. Albert did not make many friends in that lab, nor did he do any favours for the researchers’ data.

Other reports describe octopuses attempting to escape captivity at precisely the moment they are not being watched, maintaining eye-contact with the researcher until they turn away, and only then making a break for it.
