[Transient cell-in-cell formation underlies tumor relapse and resistance to immunotherapy](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.80315) #gut22 (2022)

"Here, we demonstrate in both mouse models and clinical human samples that tumor cells evade immunotherapy by generating unique **transient cell-in-cell structures**, which are resistant to killing by T cells and chemotherapies. While the outer cells in this cell-in-cell formation are often killed by reactive T cells, the inner cells remain intact and disseminate into single tumor cells once T cells are no longer present." (Abstract)

"... killer T-cells are not always effective. This is because cancer cells are naturally good at avoiding detection, and during treatment, their genes can mutate, giving them new ways to evade the immune system. Interestingly, when scientists analysed the genes of tumour cells before and after immunotherapy, they found that many of the genes that code for proteins recognized by T-cells do not change significantly. This suggests that tumours’ resistance to immune attack may be physical, rather than genetic. ... Examining cells from these [relapsing] tumours revealed that **when the immune system attacks, they reorganise by getting inside one another.** This allows some cancer cells to hide under many layers of cell membrane. At this point killer T-cells can identify and inject the outer cell with toxic granules, but it cannot reach the cells inside." (eLife digest, p. 2)

## Introduction

"... only about 30% of the patients achieve durable objective response following treatment with checkpoint blockade. Moreover, combination therapies of tumor-reactive T cells with immunomodulators such as regulatory receptors blockades are still not sufficient to profoundly improve response rates, which strongly suggests that **additional escape mechanisms are involved**." p. 3

"In both mice and humans, we found that the tumor cells remaining after immunotherapy form unique cell-in-cell structures and generate membrane architecture that is impenetrable by immune-derived lytic granules, cytotoxic compounds, and chemotherapies. While the outer cells in this formation are often killed by reactive T cells, the inner cells maintain their integrity and viability and can survive for weeks in culture containing reactive T cells. Once T cells are removed, the inner tumor cells disseminate back into their parental single cells. Overall, this work suggests that this biological process is a central mechanism through which tumor cells escape T-cell immunity and give rise to relapsed tumors." p. 3

## Results

### Tumor cells surviving immunotherapy organize in a transient cell-in-cell formation

"... these results suggest that transient in vivo mechanisms rather than inherited ones govern resistance of relapsed tumors." p. 5

"To better characterize the tumor cells that survive in mice following immunotherapy, we enzymatically digested treated tumors and sorted the live melanoma cells. Confocal analyses indicated that most of the tumor cells organize in clusters of several nuclei surrounded by a single membrane and cortical actin (Figure 2G).  Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of freshly sorted cells further corroborated a distinct segregation of the membranes and cytosols of the two cells. The inner cell was dense and seemed to have been compacted within another cell (Figure 2H)." p. 5

"ImageStream FACS analysis as well as double blind count under confocal microscopy by pathologists indicated that about half the cells that survived immunotherapy are organized in such structures where multiple membrane layers surround the cell nuclei (Figure 2J)." p. 7

### Tumor-reactive T cells induce transient cell-in-cell structure

"To test whether a specific immune cell type mediates these cell-in-cell formations, we isolated the main effector cells from tumor-bearing mice and incubated them overnight with B16F10 tumor cells. We found that only T cells—mainly CD8+, and with slower kinetics also CD4+—induce a cell-in-cell formation..." p. 7

"We also tested whether tumor cells from different tissue origins can organize in cell-in-cell formation. To this end, we incubated tumor cell lines with allogeneic T cells and quantified the number of cell-in-cell structures after 24 hr. We found significant differences between tumor cell lines; on one end are pancreatic tumors and B cell lymphoma, which do not generate cell-in-cell structures, while on the other end, almost all the colon and ovarian carcinoma tumor cells that survive T cell killing, were organized in such structures." p. 7

"We then tested whether similar structures are also formed by human cancer. To this end, we incubated tumor cell lines with pre-activated allogeneic T cells from healthy donors. Similar to our finding in mouse cells, the vast majority of breast, colon and melanoma tumors that survived killing had organized in transient cell-in-cell structures. ... In contrast, T cell and myeloid lymphomas as well as glioblastomas did not form such structures." p. 8

"... we isolated melanoma cells and their autologous reactive T infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) from freshly resected primary melanoma tumors. Overnight incubation of patient-derived melanoma and their corresponding reactive TIL, resulted in vast tumor cell killing. Approximately half of the tumor cells that survived in culture were organized in a cell-in-cell formation (Figure 3F–H)." p. 8

### IFNγ induces membrane-bound proteins on T cells that mediate tumor cell-in-cell formations

"Next, we tested if this formation can be induced by extracellular vesicles secreted by other cells. Hence, B16F10 cells were cultured overnight with extracellular vesicles from activated NK, macrophages, immortalized melanocytes (Melan A), B16F10-derived granules, or commercial 1 μM latex beads. However, none of these extracellular vesicles induced a cell-in-cell formation, suggesting this it is mediated by molecules that are highly enriched in activated T cells (Figure 4B,C)." p. 11

### Cell-in-cell formation spatially prevents the penetration of T cell-derived lytic granules to the inner tumor cells

"To assess the type of protection cell-in-cell formation provides to tumor cells, we examined their interactions with T cells under scanning electron microscope (SEM). We found that multiple T cells were attached to cell-in-cell tumors and many large pores were observed on the outer cell membrane (Figure 5C). These pores were almost completely absent upon co-culture with reactive CD8+ T cells from perforin-/- mice (Figure 5D), which have impaired tumor cell killing abilities. Furthermore, measuring the length and the duration of the immunological synapse under super-resolution microscopy showed that no reduction compared to single tumor cells. Taken jointly, these results strongly suggest that **cell-in-cell structures do not evade killing by escaping CD8+ T cell recognition**." p. 12

### T-cell-mediated cell-in-cell formation is governed by STAT3 and EGR1 signaling

"... disruption of actin filaments, blocking of mRNA synthesis or protein production completely abrogated tumor cells’ capacity to form a cell-in-cell formation, suggesting that **the structure requires de novo synthesis of genes**." p. 12

"Over 400 genes were increased in cell-in-cell formation induced by T cell secreted granules compared to untreated B16F10 cells, 215 of which were also upregulated by the tumor cells sorted from treated animals. ... EGR1 and STAT3 expression was significantly elevated in cell-in-cell tumors.  Both mice and human tumors incubated with reactive T cells had elevated their p-STAT3 levels, in comparison to untreated tumor cells, suggesting this mechanism is conserved across species." p. 14

## Discussion

"... why tumors reoccur in patients undergoing complete response remains unknown. Here, we found that tumor cells escape T-cell-based immunotherapies by forming a transient cell-in-cell structure, and not by immunoediting. These structures generate multiple membrane layers, thus reducing the probability of compounds’ internalization leading to increased tumor-cell survival." p. 16

"Many cell-in-cell formations have been described before including phagocytosis, cell cannibalism, and entosis. Recently, some of these structures have been shown to enable tumor-cell survival after chemotherapy treatment by engulfing and digesting neighboring cells. Although the present cell-in-cell structural falls within the definition [of] entosis, it differs in several key elements: First, it is triggered predominantly by reactive T cells, rather than glucose and nutrient starvation, mitosis, or loss of adherence. Additionally, it requires de novo synthesis of genes regulated by STAT3, and not through β-catenin signaling. Most importantly, the structure described here is reversible and only rarely leads to cell cannibalism and apoptosis." p. 16
