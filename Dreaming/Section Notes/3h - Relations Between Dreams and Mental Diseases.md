### H) Relations Between Dreams and Mental Diseases

"There can be no doubt that alongside of the psychology of dreams physicians will some day have to turn their attention to a *psychopathology* of dreams." p. 115

"The indisputable analogy between dreams and insanity, **extending as it does down to their characteristic details**, is one of the most powerful props of the medical theory of dream-life, which regards dreaming as a useless and disturbing process and as the expression of a reduced activity of the mind.  Nevertheless it is not to be expected that we shall find the ultimate explanation of dreams in the direction of mental disorders; for the unsatisfactory state of our knowledge of the origin of these latter conditions is generally recognized.  It is quite likely, on the contrary, that **a modification of our attitude towards dreams will at the same time affect our views upon the internal mechanism of mental disorders and that we shall be working towards and explanation of the psychoses while we are endeavouring to throw some light on the mystery of dreams**." p. 117
