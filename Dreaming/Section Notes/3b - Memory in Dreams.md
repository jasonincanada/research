### B) Memory in Dreams

"All the material making up the content of a dream is in some way derived from experience, that is to say, has been reproduced or remembered in the dream--so much at least we may regard as an undisputed fact. ... The connection requires ... to be looked for diligently, and in a whole quantity of cases it may long remain hidden." p. 44

"Then at last, often after a long interval, some fresh experience recalls the lost memory of the other event and at the same time reveals the source of the dream. We are thus driven to admit that in the dream we **knew and remembered something which was beyond the reach of our waking memory.**" p. 45

* Delboeuf (1885)'s *Asplenium ruta muralis* dream. p. 45

"The fact that dreams have at their command memories which are inaccessible in waking life is **so remarkable and of such theoretical importance** that I should like to draw still more attention to it by relating some further 'hypermnesic' dreams."

* Maury (1878)'s *Mussidan* dream. p. 46

"St. Denys (1867) describes a hypermnesic dream which has a special peculiarity, for it was **followed by another dream which completed the recognition of what was at first an unidentified memory**" p. 47

"No one who occupies himself with dreams can, I believe, fail to discover that it is a very common event for a dream to give evidence of knowledge and memories which the waking subject is unaware of possessing. In my psycho-analytic work with nervous patients ... I am in a position several times a week to prove to patients from their dreams that they are really quite familiar with quotations, obscene words and so on, and make use of them in their dreams, though they have forgotten them in their waking life." p. 47

* his patient's Kontuszowka dream p. 47

I wrote "brioche" in the margin here because I had the shape of the undulating contours of such bread floating around my head on this evening (1 Sep 2021) but I don't recall what prompted it from this part of the book text.  I'm doing 30-min to 60-min of nightly French language lessons on DuoLingo during this time and it's likely brioche was one of the words I encountered

"I have noticed myself from my own dreams how much it is a **matter of chance** whether one discovers the source of particular elements of a dream."  Fascinating passage here about his dream of a church tower and sandstone images, and his re-discovering on a return trip to Padua in 1907 the source imagery from his prior trip in 1895. p. 48

Section on *choice* of material, which is the "third, most striking and least comprehensible characteristic of memory in dreams". p. 51

Hildebrandt (1875) writes: "For the remarkable thing is that dreams derive their elements not from major and stirring evetns nor the powerful and compelling interests of the preceding day, but from incidental details, from the worthless fragments, one might say, of what has been recently experienced or of the remoter past.  A family bereavement, which has moved us deeply and under whose immediate shadow we have fallen asleep late at night, is blotted out of our memory till with our first waking moment it returns to it again with disturbing violence. On the other hand, a wart on the forehead of a stranger whom we met in the street and to whom we gave no second thought after passing him *has* a part to play in our dream" p. 51

Freud notes as "remarkable" the preference shown for indifferent and consequently unattended elements of dreaming life.  Calkins (1893) did a statistical study of her and her collaborator's dreams, in 11% there "was no visible connection with waking life."  Hildebrandt (1875) lamented the thanklessness of the task of tracing back every dream element to an event in waking life, though Freud notes he would have been on the path to his (Freud's) own theory had he kept at it.  "I can only regret that this keen-sighted author allowed himself to be deterred from following the path which had this inauspicious beginning; if he had followed it, it would have led him to the very heart of the explanation of dreams." p. 53

"Strumpell rightly points out that dreams do not reproduce experiences. They take one step forward, but the next step in the chain is omitted, or appears in an altered form, or is replaced by something entirely extraneous. Dreams yield no more than *fragments* of reproductions; and this is so general a rule that theoretical conclusions may be based on it." p. 53
