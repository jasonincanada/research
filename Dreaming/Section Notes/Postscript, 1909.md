## Postscript, 1909

(Written about a decade after the publication of the first edition, which famously sold no more than about 400 copies in its first six years)

"The fact that I have not extended my account of the literature dealing with the problems of dreams to cover the period between the first and second editions of this book stands in need of a justification."

"The result \[of continuing to add subsequent research material to a followup edition\]" would have been of very little use or instruction.  For the intervening nine years have produced nothing new or valuable either in factual material or in opinions that might throw light on the subject.  In the majority of publications that have appeared during the interval my work has remained unmentioned and unconsidered. It has, of course, received least attention from those who are engaged in what is described as 'research' into dreams, and who have thus provided a shining example of the repugnance to learning anything new which is characteristic of men of science. ... I should certantly be justified in my turn in disregarding the literature that has been issued since the publication of this book.  The few notices of it that have appeared in scientific periodicals show so much *lack* of understanding and so much *mis*understanding that my only reply to the critics would be to suggest their reading the book again--or perhaps, indeed, merely to suggest their reading it." p. 118

"The extensive monograph on dreams by Sante de Sanctis (1899) ... was published almost simultaneously with my *Interpretation of Dreams*, so that neither I nor the Italian author was able to comment upon each other's work.  I have unfortunately been unable to escape the conclusion that his painstaking volume is totally deficient in ideas--so much so, in fact, that it would not even lead one to suspect the existence of the problems with which I have dealt." p. 119

But the situation isn't a total loss for Freud, who was

"... the more pleased when, in an unexpected quarter, I made the chance discovery of a view of dreams which coincides entirely with the core of my own theory. It is impossible, for chronological reasons, that the statement in question can have been influenced by my book. I must therefore hail it as the single discoverable instance in the literature of the subject of an independent thinker who is in agreement with the essence of my theory of dreams.  The book which contains the passage upon dreaming which I have in mind appeared in its second edition in 1900 under the title of *Phantasien eines Realisten* by 'Lynkeus'"
