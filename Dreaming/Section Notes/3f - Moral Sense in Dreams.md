### F) The Moral Sense in Dreams

Jessen (1855): "Nor do we become better or more virtuous in sleep. On the contrary, conscience seems to be silent in dreams, for we feel no pity in them and may commit the worst crimes--theft, violence and murder--with complete indifference and with no subsequent feelings of remorse."

Radestock (1879): "Judgement \[sic\] is extremely weak and ethical indifference reigns supreme." ... "Radestock says that dreams often do no more than reveal to us what we would not admit to ourselves and that it is therefore unfair of us to stigmatize them as liars and deceivers.  Erdman (1852) writes: '**Dreams have never shown me what I ought to think of a man; but I have occasionally learnt from a dream, greatly to my own astonishment, what I *do* think of a man and how I feel towards him**'" p. 98
