### G) Theories of Dreaming and Its Function

Freud divides theories of dreams into "three rough groups, according to their underlying assumptions as to the amount of and nature of psychical activity in dreams." p. 102

1. the whole of psychical activity continues in dreams, p. 102
1. "dreams imply a lowering of psychical activity, loosening of connections, and an impoverishment of the material accessible", p. 102
1. those "which ascribe to the dreaming mind a capacity and inclination for carrying out special psychical activities of which it is largely or totally incapable in waking life", p. 108

"The theory according to which only a fragment of mental activity finds expression in dreams, since it has been paralysed by sleep, is by far the most popular with medical writers and in the scientific world generally." p. 103
