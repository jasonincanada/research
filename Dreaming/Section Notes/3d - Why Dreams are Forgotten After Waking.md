### D) Why Dreams are Forgotten After Waking

"They can, of course, be remembered; for we only know dreams from our memory of them after we are awake.  But we very often have a feeling that we have only remembered a dream in part and that there was more of it during the night... On the other hand, it sometimes happens that dreams show an extraordinary persistence in the memory.  I have analysed dreams in my patients which occurred twenty-five and more years earlier; and I can remember a dream of my own separated by at least thirty-seven years from today and yet as fresh as ever in my memory.  **All of this is very remarkable and not immediately intelligible.**" p. 73

"If sensations, ideas, thoughts, and so on, are to attain a certain degree of susceptibility to being rememebered, it is essential that they should not remain isolated but should be arranged in appropriate **concatenations and groupings**. If a short line of verse is divided up into its component words and these are mixed up, it becomes very hard to remember. '**If words are properly arranged and put into the relevant order, one word will help another, and the whole, being charged with meaning, will be easily taken up by the memory and retained for a long time.**' (Strumpell 1877)" p. 74

"... dreams scarcely ever take over **ordered recollections** from waking life, but only details selected from them, which they **tear from the psychical context in which they are usually remembered** in the waking state." p. 75

Two more reasons dreams are forgotten, per Bonatelli (1880) p. 75:
* "the alteration in coenaesthesia between the sleeping and waking states is unfavourable to reciprocal reproduction between them"
* "the different arrangement of the ideational material in dreams makes them untranslatable, as it were, for waking consciousness"
