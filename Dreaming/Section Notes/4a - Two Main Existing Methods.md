"The lay world has from the earliest times concerned itself with 'interpreting' dreams and in its attempts to do so it has made use of two essentially different methods." p. 122

"The first ... considers the content of the dream as a whole and seeks to replace it by another content which is intelligible and in certain respects analogous to the original one.  This is '*symbolic*' dream-interpreting."

* Joseph's explanation of Pharoah's dream from the Bible about seven fat and seven lean cows

"Most of the artificial dreams constructed by imaginative writers are designed for a symbolic interpretation of this sort."

"The second \[method\] ... might be described as the '*decoding*' method, since it treats dreams as a kind of cryptography in which each sign can be translated into another sign having a known meaning, in accordance with a fixed key." p. 123

* these are the "dream dictionaries" that can be bought in a store

This is a "purely mechanical" translation.  A somewhat developed version of this idea was mentioned by Artemidorus of Daldis (2nd century AD), who took into account "not only the content of the dream but also the character and circumstances of the dreamer; so that the same dream-element will have a different meaning for a rich man, a married man ..." p. 123

"It cannot be doubted for a moment that neither of the two popular procedures for interpreting dreams can be employed for a scientific treatment of the subject. The symbolic method is restricted in its application and incapable of being laid down on general lines. In the case of the decoding method, everything depends on the trustworthiness of the 'key'--the dream-book, and of this we have no guarantee.  Thus one might ... rule out the problem of dream-interpretation as a purely fanciful task.

"But I have been taught better. I have been driven to realize that here once more we have one of those not infrequent cases in which an ancient and jealously held popular belief seems to be nearer the truth than the judgement of the prevalent science of today. I must affirm that dreams really have a meaning and that a scientific procedure for interpreting them is possible." p. 124
