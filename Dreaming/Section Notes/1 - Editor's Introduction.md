"*The Interpretation of Dreams* was one of the two books--the *Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality* (1905d) was the other--which Freud kept more or less systematically 'up to date' as they passed through their series of editions. **After the third edition of the present work, the changes in it were not indicated in any way**" p. xii
* 8 editions of the book in total

"By far the greater number of additions dealing with any single subject are those concerned with **symbolism in dreams**. Freud explains ... that he arrived late at a full realization of the importance of this side of the subject. ... Several pages on sexual symbolism were inserted at the end of ... Chapter V.  These were very considerably expanded in the third edition (1911), while the original passage in Chapter VI still remained unaltered." p. xiii

"Students of Freud's theoretical writings have been aware that even in his profoundest psychological speculations little or no discussion is to be found upon some of the *most* fundamental of the concepts of which he makes use: such concepts, for instance, as **'mental energy,' 'sums of excitation,' 'cathexis,' 'quantity,' 'intensity,'** and so on.  Almost the only explicit approach ... in which he lays down a hypotheses that 'in mental functions something is to be distinguished--a charge of affect or sum of excitation--which possesses **all the characteristics of a quantity** (though we have no means of measuring it), which is capable of **increase, diminution, displacement and discharge**" p. xv

"The essence of Freud's 'Project' lay in the notion of combining into a single whole two theories of different origin." p. xvi
* first derived from the psychological school of Helmholtz
	* neurophysiology and hence psychology governed by chemico-physical laws only
* second was anatomical doctrine of the neurone
	* becoming accepted by neuro-anatomists at the end of the 1880s
	* term "synapse" introduced by Foster/Sherrington in 1897

"The nervous system endeavours to keep constant something in its functional condition that may be described as the '**sum of excitation**'" p. xvi

Freud's scheme divides neurones into three classes/systems by mode of function:
* external stimuli
* internal excitation
	* both of these purely quantitative
	* actions determined by magnitude of nervous excitations
* qualitative differences between conscious sensations/feelings

"This division of the neurones into three systems was the basis of elaborate physiological explanations of such things as the working of memory, the perception of reality, the process of thought, and also the phenomena of dreaming and of neurotic disorder." p. xvii

* obscurities and difficulties accumulate
* interest gradually diverted to psychological and clinical problems
* eventually abandoned whole scheme

Freud regularly shared his book manuscripts with Fliess, who "seems to have had considerable influence on the final shape of the book" (p. xix)

Letter 119 (to Fliess), 21 Sep 1899: "Somewhere hidden within me I too have some fragmentary sense of form, some appreciation of beauty as a species of perfection; and the involved sentences of my book on dreams, bolstered up on indirect phrases and with sidelong glances at their subject-matter, have gravely affronted some ideal within me. And I am scarcely wrong in regarding this lack of form as a sign of an incomplete mastery of the material."  p. xix
