### C) Stimuli and Sources of Dreams

"Any complete enumeration of the sources of dreams leads to a recognition of **four** kinds of source" p. 55

1. external (objective) sensory excitations
1. internal (subjective) sensory excitations
1. internal (organic) somatic stimuli
1. purely psychical sources of stimulation

#### 1. External sensory stimuli

Fascinating section on dream narration bunching up at the end of the dream in a seemingly impossible temporal compression:

"Many writers have commented upon 'the striking facility with which dreams are able to weave a sudden impression from the world of the senses in their own structure so that it comes as what appears to be a pre-arranged catastrophe that has been gradually led up to.'" Hildebrandt (1875) p. 58

Hildebrandt used an alarm clock in his youth to be up at a fixed hour, reported **hundreds** of occurrences of the noise of the alarm working its way into "an ostensibly lengthy and connected dream as though the whole dream had been leading up to that one event and had reached its appointed end in what was a logically indispensable climax." p. 58

* Volkelt (1875)'s composer's dream of his music class students yelling fire in a sequence of mutating shouts: Oh ja -> Orja! -> Eurjo! -> Feuerjo! due to an actual fire in the streets outside
* Garnier (1865)'s dream recounted by Napolean of waking up in his carriage from a bomb explosion
* Maury (1878)'s extended execution sequence at a tribunal, questioned at length by a panel, led out to be executed via guillotine and woke up to find the top of the bed fallen down on his neck


#### 2. Internal sensory excitations

"After some practice \[Trumbull\] (1892) succeeded in being able to wake himself suddenly without opening his eyes, from two to five minutes after gradually falling asleep.  He thus had an opportunity of comparing the retinal sensations which were just disappearing with the dream-images persisting in his memory. **He declares that it was possible in every case to recognize an internal relation between the two**" p. 64

#### 3. Internal organic somatic stimuli

"Nevertheless, though these facts are established beyond a doubt, their importance for the study of the sources of dreams is not so great as might have been hoped.  Dreams are phenomena which occur in healthy people--perhaps in everyone, perhaps every night--and it is obvious that organic illness cannot be counted among its indispensable conditions.  And what we are concerned with is not the origin of certain special dreams but the source that instigates the ordinary dreams of normal people." p. 66

"There is a fair amount of agreement, however, over the interpretation of various forms of dreams that are described as 'typical,' because they occur in large numbers of people and with very similar content.  Such are the familiar dreams of falling from a height, of teeth falling out, of flying and of embarassment at being naked or insufficiently clad." p. 69

Vold (1896) carried out experiments moving the sleeper's limbs and looking for corresponding results in their dreams.  Findings p. 70:
1. position of limb in dream corresponds approximately to position in reality
1. "If we dream of a limb moving, then one of the positions passed through in the course of completing the movement **invariably corresponds to the limb's actual position**" (intimations of the [Intermediate value theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem)?)
1. position of dreamer's limb may be ascribed to someone else in the dream
1. limb movement may be *hindered* in the dream
1. limb in question may appear as an animal/monster, with an analogy established between the limb and the animal
1. position can influence thoughts by some connection, eg. fingers relate to numbers

#### 4. Psychical sources of stimulation

"We shall find later that the enigma of the formation of dreams can be solved by the revelation of an **unsuspected psychical source of stimulation.**" p. 72
