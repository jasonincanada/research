## Postscript, 1914

"The [[Postscript, 1909|preceding plea]] of justification was written in 1909. I am bound to admit that since then the situation has changed; my contribution to the interpretation of dreams is no longer neglected by writers on the subject. The new state of affairs, however, has now made it quite out of the question for me to extend my previous account of the literature.  *The Interpretation of Dreams* has raised a whole series of fresh considerations and problems which have been discussed in a great variety of ways. I cannot give an account of these works, however, before I have expounded those views of my own on which they are based.  I have therefore dealt with whatever seems to me of value in the latest literature at its appropriate place in the course of the discussion which now follows." p. 120
