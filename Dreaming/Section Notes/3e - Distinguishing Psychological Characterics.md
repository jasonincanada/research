### E) Distinguishing Psychological Characteristics of Dreams

"The question arises whether in dreams there may not **be modifications in the processes of the mind** which produce the impression we are discussing"

"The transformation of ideas into hallucinations is not the only respect in which dreams differ from corresponding thoughts in waking life.  Dreams construct a situation out of these images; they represent an event which is actually happening. ... But this feature of dream-life can only be fully understood if we further recognize that in dreams ... we appear not to *think* but to *experience*; that is to say, we attach complete belief to the hallucinations.  Not until we wake up does the critical comment arise that we have not experienced anything but have merely been thinking in a peculiar way, or in other words dreaming.  **It is this characteristic that distinguishes true dreams from daydreaming, which is never confused with reality.**" p. 80

"The waking mind produces ideas and thoughts in verbal images and in speech; but in dreams it does so in true sensory images.  Moreover, **there is a spatial consciousness in dreams**, since sensations and images are assigned to an external space, just as they are in waking.  **It must therefore be allowed that in dreams the mind is in the same relation to its images and perceptions as it is in waking.**" p. 80

"Dreams are disconnected, they accept the most violent contradictions without the least objection, they admit impossibilities, they disregard knowledge which carries great weight with us in the day-time, they reveal us as ethical and moral imbeciles.  **Anyone who when he was awake behaved in the sort of way that is shown in situations in dreams would be considered insane**." p. 83

Strumpell (1877) remarks that "in dreams--even, of course, where there is no manifest nonsense--**there is an eclipse of all the logical operations of the mind which are based on relations and connections**." p. 86
