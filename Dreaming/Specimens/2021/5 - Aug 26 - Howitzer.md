### 6:30 am

I’m standing on porch of a house on the left (west) side of a road. The road goes up a few more houses and ends at a T-junction, at the top of which is another house whose owner is lobbing some sort of explosive rounds out of some sort of #howitzer or cannon southwards. I’m standing on the porch curiously watching these rounds being shot, seemingly without concern for my own risk of being injured or killed. One round actually does land close enough for me to sense the shock wave, but there were no injuries. #weapon
