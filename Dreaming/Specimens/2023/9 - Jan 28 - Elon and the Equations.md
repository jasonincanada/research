### The Proof

**6:00 am**

I've been spending all my time at some educational institute or some company that involves on-site education, a multi-floored building with many rooms, many of which have glass walls. A teacher-type person has been trying to spread awareness of a proof involving relatively simple equations. Early on in the dream it doesn't seem important to me, but I gradually grow interested in it due to how ardently this person is trying to find people to understand it. He seems to have only one student, who is doing his best to pick it up. The proof is listed in a short section in the middle of a longer textbook, a dark-coloured (purple?) hardcover book. In the process of making it easier to understand, he has replaced two parts of it with other symbols, and a clever rearrangement allows the whole thing to equal 0. I started the dream only vaguely interested in it, but as I see how seriously the student is trying to pick it up, it gets more and more obvious that its applications are powerful and important. Other than the three of us, nobody else in the building seems to care about it or even know about it.

I'm just an anonymous student or employee here, so I spend a lot of my time in a small, cramped, closet-sized portion of a room in the basement, minding my own business, generally aware of the proof though I don't understand it. There is a small panel in front of me showing a schematic of this and surrounding rooms, with a small horizontal slit of light underneath the room numbers. This small hideaway in the basement is room 69. The teacher of the proof is nearby here at one point in an adjacent, somewhat larger room, teaching his student to understand the proof and instilling its importance. It's somehow related to the fundamental theorem of algebra, and it involves some clever reasoning about an equation that, although critically important, isn't all that difficult to write down on paper. It reminds me of a proof I saw in a video by Numberphile ([Fundamental Theorem of Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shEk8sz1oOw&t=573s), linked to the specific part, though in the dream there is no geometric rendering, just equations and reasoning).

At one point I'm in a hallway on a floor higher than the basement room, looking into a classroom setting through a glass wall. On the whiteboard a teacher is showing something rendered in bra-ket notation with some operators in between the bra and ket.

### Elon

Elon Musk has been around and getting on my nerves in various ways. I think he owns this company or institute, so I try not to respond in any way when he annoys or harasses me, in order to avoid antagonizing him or escalating things further. At one point, he steals some sort of small fidget thingy that I'd been carrying around with me, a dark-coloured (purple?) plastic thing, about the size of a lighter, and shaped like a 3-dimensional S tetromino. The two components are not fixed though, and can slide back and forth along each other, so you can use it as a fidgeting device. (Like a fidget spinner, but a fidget slider?) Elon steals it from me, and I let him keep it, making no attempt to get it back.

At one point, to my surprise, Elon invites me to go somewhere (I think for lunch) with him, just me and him. So I quietly follow behind him as we walk downstairs, surprised and feeling a boost in confidence and mood with him taking an interest in me. We get to the main glass entrance to leave, but after he steps just outside, he stops and, without turning around, lets the glass doors slide closed behind him, purposely trapping me inside. I take it as an affront, and without skipping a beat I abandon the idea of following him anywhere, so as not to entertain his shenanigans at my expense any further. I turn around and head back upstairs and walk to a glass-walled conference room occupied by about a dozen people.

As I'm approaching the room I hear someone inside say "It's Jason." I had started off as a nobody in this place, but have since gained a bit of social status somehow, so people recognize me now. Someone says something like "How did he get in here without a pass?" Then I notice the front of our shirts have some kind of mutable status built into the design showing whether we're allowed in the building or not, and mine had faded into not-allowed status.

There's a bit of a time gap here, because the reason my shirt's status had changed was because I had actually left the building via the entrance Elon had blocked me at. But this time I really had left the building, and had walked around for a few moments before returning inside. Elon wasn't there at that point, so it must have been a different occurrence of being at that entrance. I reply to the group, "Well, I just walked back in, nothing prevented me from entering," as though my shirt's non-status was not limiting my entry into the building.

Instead of entering the room right away, I hold up my right hand and make a bending gesture with my index finger as if to signal, "Come here for a second." Nobody really stirs to move, so I abruptly change my mind about using a gesture to induce someone to come to me, realizing it's too soon after the acquisition of my social clout to leverage it merely with a lazy finger movement. Instead, I ought to put in the effort to verbally request the person to come out and talk to me. So I open the door to the room and peek in to speak. But by this point, the leader of the group, who had been sitting at the center of the opposite side of the table, was goofing around and had purposely fallen backwards off his chair, with his legs splayed up in the air to get everybody laughing. Realizing he's too busy to answer my inquiry, I wander down the hall, back to the teaching room that had earlier had the bra-ket expression on the board.

### Leaving

Later on in the day, I'm leaving the building at the same with a group of others. I'm not really close friends with them; the entourage is due to us all leaving at the same time and not because we planned to leave as a group. However, we do stay together, mingling and conversing as we walk away for the day.

We walk past some microcosmic model of the environs of the dream setting, with a globe-sized dome protruding from the top of a waist-high stand. The model is colored in earthly light blues and greens, with labels naming the various components.

There is some exciting social event coming up, and Jennifer G is pleading with her dark-skinned manager for vacation time off for the event. The manager doesn't think about Jennifer's request for too long before rejecting it, politely but firmly saying, "No, it's too important to have you working, so you can't have the time off," expecting that would put an end to the discussion. She continues her plea with a number of justifications, including, ironically, that the same day last year made so much money for the business. He agrees that yes it did, as though reinforcing why he needs her to work that day. He adds, "You young programmers need to be working and making money." She responds, "You too," though he is obviously older and much more of a manager than a programmer.

We walk down a roughly 1-meter wide grassy walkway bounded by cement curbs, with a drive-through lane on the right side. A pickup truck lets a gap open up ahead of him to let us pass, but we show intent to walk further down the grassy lane as if saying "Thanks, but you go ahead."

I'm part of the group for now because we're walking in generally the same direction, but our destinations are different. I'm walking home, though I actually have no idea where I live, just somewhere off in the direction of the metropolis on the horizon. I'm eager to get home and find a copy of the dark-coloured textbook so I can look up the proof, which I have come to realize is very important. It seems only to be known by the teacher, the guy who was being taught it, and nobody else in the building. My main motivation now is to get home, find a copy of the book and do whatever it takes to understand it too.

## Safe Deposit Box

**11:00 am**

I'm in a mostly empty room (similar to the living room of my first basement apartment on Eastlawn Ave) that is actually part of a bank. A bank employee or manager grants me my strange request to search through the contents of a different customer's safe deposit box. I'm looking for something in relation to the prior dream I had earlier in the morning. After rummaging around the contents for a while, it occurs to me I neglected to carefully remember the order of the contents, so I could put it all back together the way I found it and hide that I was looking through it at all.

After not finding what I was looking for, I put it all back as neatly as I can. While closing it up, I realize I've made another mistake: I left my fingerprints on the silver coins I was handling. I don't worry too much about it though, because when the owner of the deposit box finds out it was related to the important issues of the prior dream, he will hopefully be understanding.

## The Indoor Ride

I'm standing on the floor in a big room with a ~100 foot high ceiling. The room hosts some kind of indoor carnival ride: a big spherical metal skeleton with places for people to hook up to the outside of it. It rotates slowly in different ways, which gives the riders a thrill, especially as they traverse the very top of the room when they are almost up to the ceiling, the highest they can get, and where they are mostly upside-down.
