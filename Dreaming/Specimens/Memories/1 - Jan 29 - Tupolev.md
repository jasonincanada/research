## Tupolev

Date: 29 January 2022

I was lying in bed last night, and at one point I was thinking about standing up rigidly straight, doing some tai chi form or technique.  I then quickly translated my position from here to the North Pole, as if by a quick jump or nearly immediate movement.  At about the same time I noticed two attentional shifts, in this order:

First, I thought of the Cessna landings I used to do in MS Flight Simulator around 20 years ago, on wide expanses of ice way up in the Arctic, touch-and-goes for quite a distance, since I liked flaring and gently landing the plane over and over again, especially from a third-person chase plane perspective.

Second, the name "Tupolev" entered my mind pre-formed, from no obvious source or specific recollection; I don't think I've heard it before.  An obviously Russian name, I initially considered it to be an association to the [Antonov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonov_An-225_Mriya) cargo planes, the largest in the world if I'm not mistaken.  After a moment's reflection, I realized the linguistic structure of the name embodied a different and related meaning:

| Phoneme | Meaning                                                      |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Tu      | French "you"                                                 |
| pol     | English [North] "pole"                                       |
| lev     | From "levitate", to lift up; or "se lever", French to get up |
 
This alternative meaning is easy to interpret: it's a frenchification of the kinetic image I had considered as I moved immediately from around this latitude to the North pole in one go. So the *constructed* name Tupolev, in addition to being structurally similar to Antonov, the plane, also represented the phrase: "You to the pole are lifted" or "You to the pole fly"
