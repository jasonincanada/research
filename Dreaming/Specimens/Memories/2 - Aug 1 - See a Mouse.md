## See A Headless Mouse

### Context

Late Aug 1, 2022, lying in bed reflecting on the day's events and pending anxieties

### Backstory

For a couple days there's been a foul odor coming from somewhere in the vicinity of my fridge, gradually building in pungency. The source wasn't immediately obvious, since the inside of my fridge and freezer smelled normal; no food was expired or decaying. The first day I detected the odor, I thought it was broccoli I had fried the night before and still had out on the kitchen table (I usually make a meal, saran wrap it, and pick at it throughout the afternoon/evening whenever I pass through the kitchen). I threw out that plate of leftover food as normal, hoping that was it, and waited out the rest of the day.

The next day, I realized it definitely wasn't the broccoli, since the smell is now even stronger. It's got to be a dead animal, almost certainly a mouse, since I see and hear evidence of them in my kitchen all the time. I pulled the fridge out from against the wall a bit to check behind, finding nothing but some dust. Pushed it away from the counter about half a foot to check the ground beside it, still nothing. So I placed it back in its normal spot and went for a walk, still puzzled.

I returned home about 25 minutes later and went to check on the smell--only to find it was almost completely undetectable! Now I'm really puzzled since I didn't find the cause of the odor but it's now reduced to almost nothing. I considered the possibility that I had been imagining the odor and something about the vigor of my evening walk knocked my senses back into normal condition. But I quickly dismissed that as an answer, since the odor was locationally dependent on my fridge--I only detected it there and nowhere else.

### That night

I was lying in bed ruminating on the day and the immediate future, mostly about the job search I'm currently undertaking and its attendant anxieties, particularly around interviews. I was no longer actively thinking about the foul odor, having pushed it out of my mind in order to mindset what I might say to employers about my past work. At my prior job I had been expected to build a headless CMS by myself (!). While considering this, I said out loud, in a derisive tone, "I was asked to build a headless CMS". But, quite interestingly and unexpectedly, it came out as "headless CM *mouse*". So a "mouse" sound instead of "mess".

When I'm thinking alone I tend to talk out loud a lot, so that in itself wasn't notable. But the verbal distortion caught me off guard, so I began thinking about what could have caused it. First step, the obvious freudian linguistic associations/mutations, which was this exact sequence, all thought within a couple of seconds:

| Phrase               | Comments                                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Headless CMS         | Starting phrase                           |
| Headless see em ess  | Convert to phonetic representation        |
| Headless see em ouse | Distort "ess" to "ouse"                   |
| Headless see a mouse | Closest valid spelling/meaning            |
| See a headless mouse | Reorder into grammatically correct phrase |

With the phrase now in the second person imperative, I went ahead and pictured a headless mouse for a second, lying under my fridge. But how can a mouse possibly be headless? What about a fridge would cut its head off?

A few moments after the linguistic train led me back to the thought of mice, I had a sudden sensory recollection. I did indeed hear two mice fighting behind or underneath my fridge a couple nights prior as I was walking by to go upstairs. I had put it out of my mind quickly and didn't think about it again until this session of reflection. With this memory resurfaced, it was easy to put the rest of the mystery together after a moment of thought:

During the mouse fight two nights prior, one mouse must have killed the other. It must have died right next to the heat source on/underneath my fridge, and the heat turbo-charged the decay and the smell which was why it was so pungent and overwhelming after a couple days. When I moved the fridge to check behind and beside it, I must have dragged the mouse away from the heat source, then when I put the fridge back to its normal position, the mouse was no longer close enough to the heat source to be affected by it. In the time it took me to take my walk the worst of the smell had dissipated (I had all the windows open when I left).

(Note, I'll be able to confirm this later when I have an extra pair of arms to help me tilt the fridge around. But the reality of it is secondary to the psychological phenomena described here, so it's not important whether my solution is actually correct)

### Questions Raised

What made my voice unconsciously curl the term "CMS" to "See A Mouse", which led directly to a series of phrase mutations that ended up solving the puzzle of the strange smell?
