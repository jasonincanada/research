I'm packing up my things near the end of some project or trip, feeling good to be leaving the area.  I start #walking down a sidewalk in the middle of the day, starting off in the general direction I need to go, contemplating how I'm going to make the whole trip since it's quite a long distance.

I look down at my device, and like magic it somehow knows where I am going and has already started booking the trip for me.  There is a row for each leg of the trip it is organizing, and as each leg is successfully booked, the row turns from black to green.
