### 7 am

I'm concerned that a malfunctioning dryer will catch fire and burn down the unfamiliar building I'm in. A few attempts to turn it on are frightening as there is something obviously broken within. Small flames protrude from its casing as it makes loud tumbling and banging sounds like something is off-balance within. The flames jump to a nearby decorated Christmas tree where they flutter amongst the pine needles†, and I call out excitedly for fire extinguishers, though if there's anybody in the area, nobody bothers to get one. The small fires seem to go out on their own anyway.

By this point late in the sleep cycle (it's about 6am) I'm waking up every few minutes with a full bladder but I force myself to fall back asleep to resume the dream.

When I do, there is now an empty segment along the wall where the laundry facilities had been. The owner had moved them up to the floor above and to the neighbouring room, but the floor was only about 90% of the way to the one above. With a foot-or-two gap in the top of the old laundry wall I could see that they'd moved the dryer up there, into a sort of semi-attic, somewhat appropriate for utilities, though maybe not dangerously flammable ones. I'm now even more worried because the dryer would be harder to reach in the event that it does catch fire, and I'm concerned the whole building they're in might burn down because of it. The main resident of this place is a girl I have romantic feelings for (probably AC from my Ottawa days), but when I notice a guy hanging around off to my left, no doubt already occupying the spot I was just contemplating, I decide not to bother pursuing her any further. I told her I'd be going now and would never see her again.

Wake again to the pressure of a full bladder, fall back asleep.

I'm leaving a domed (concrete?) building, into broad daylight, climbing up on the curved roof to make it back to street level. An unfamiliar man behind me must be someone I already know because he leans in to me at a pace that was surely to kiss me goodbye, but I catch him halfway with my left hand, cupped slightly and patting the right side of his face twice quickly as if to say "There there, take care now." He gets the hint and slinks away, and I head out on the rest of my trip.

Two problems left now: to reactivate my Twitter account and to find home, both of which are a problem. I don't know where home even is, though I know it's nowhere close, not in this commercial area of an unfamiliar city somewhere. I'm very frustrated with the Twitter thing because it should be way easier to reactivate my account and way easier to know how. After some wandering around I finally come upon a business off to my right that is covered in hundreds of company logos. I'm able to spot the blue Twitter bird as one of them, but upon looking closer I notice the product on offer is the paid Twitter Blue service. I'm frustrated again since I don't want a new paid subscription, I just want my damn account reactivated.

Right when I give up on my Twitter account and resume walking in the direction I think is home, the Twitter terms of service appear in front of me, around neck level, having smoothly coursed in at an oblique angle from the horizon. It's similar to the scrolling introductory texts at the start of every Star Wars film, except opposite in every way except the angle. It's roughly the same oblique angle, but instead of orange text on a black background in space, flowing slowly away, it's black text on a paper-white background presenting itself towards me for review and acceptance. I wake up again with the urge to pee; this time I give in and head downstairs to the main floor to do so.

A thin, transparent swirl deep in each nostril, a barely visible tingle at the bottom arc of each eye."*
